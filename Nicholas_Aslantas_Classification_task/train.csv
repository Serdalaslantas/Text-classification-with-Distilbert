Comparing the two-year and 10-year time frames

and continued concerns according to GRPS
respondents (Figure 2.2). The top right of the graph
indicates global risks that are perceived to be
the most severe in both the short and long term.
These are consistent areas of global concern and,
arguably, attention. Four environmental risks have

worsening scores over the course of the 10-year

we face various environmental and socioeconomic

outlines an illustrative, but non-exhaustive set of midterm futures to help support business leaders and

progression of the crises we are facing today.

We use two global drivers – geoeconomic
confrontation and speed of climate action –
to create four futures we may face by 2030,
considering potential implications based on the
evolution of these risks and their interactions
(Figure 3.2).

First, we explore the potential risks of a failure of
climate-change adaptation and failure of climate
mitigation efforts, described in Chapter 1.2,
Climate action hiatus, and the extent to which
these failures could result in conditions of scarcity,
on a continuum (y-axis):

•  Accelerated climate action: climate action
and associated funding and innovation are
prioritized. By 2030, we see persistently
expanding but largely well-managed impacts of
climate change, nature loss, natural disasters

Technology companies should prepare for
potential challenges for some of their key
insurance lines going forward. Marsh tracked
the cost of seven key coverages since 2011 for
tech companies. We found that only workers’
compensation premiums are lower in 2022
than they were in 2012 (see Figure 8).
Cyber premiums have more than quadrupled for tech companies since 2012 —
with especially large jumps since 2019. And although D&O rates are starting to

The role of Internal Audit
Assess the quality of the overall crisis management
system, by ensuring that key threats have been
identified and appropriate response plans are in place
and tested during emergency exercises. Internal
Audit should review whether the business continuity
or crisis response plans are fit for purpose and
whether emerging risks and evolving key threats
have been considered. Internal Audit should also
seek evidence of the governance around crisis
decision-making and the integrity of data and
information reported to crisis committees.

The role of Internal Audit

awareness of the types of assurance the merger will
obtain during its life cycle, from real-time assurance
through to ‘go’ / ‘no-go’ live assurance. ",,0

overarching concerns related to supply chain challenges

to three risks related to the organization’s overall work

of risk issues to appropriate leaders. A similar churn is

observed for 2032 relative to 2031. In comparing the top

risks for 2031 and 2032, exposure to substitute products

horizons, the risk scores for data privacy and cyber threats

increased year-over-year compared to our prior year

customer expectations at an all-time high, the ability to

enable consumers to buy anything, anywhere, anytime, and

The supply chain game

Last year, CPG respondents rated the supply chain crisis

as their foremost risk issue, above even market conditions

related to the pandemic and pandemic-related government

policies. The latest survey shows this trend isn’t going away,

as it was again rated the top risk by the combined CPG and

retail group.

Cyber incidents are also the cause of business
interruption (BI) that Allianz Risk Barometer
respondents fear most (45%), reflecting ongoing
concern for disruption caused by ransomware
attacks, IT system and cloud outages and the
threat of cyber war.

Severe BI can result from a wide range of cyberrelated triggers, including malicious attacks by
criminals or state-backed hackers, human error
or technical glitches. According to Allianz analysis
of cyber-related insurance industry claims that
it has been involved with over the past five
years, BI is the main cost driver for 57% of claims
globally and is a significant driver for the rising
severity of claims, including from ransomware
attacks, which have proliferated in recent years.
Hackers increasingly target both digital and
physical supply chains providing opportunities to
simultaneously attack multiple companies and
gain additional leverage for extortion.

too, faces massive economic challenges, much
greater than other major countries. Its economy
is still expected to surpass that of the United States
in GDP by 2030, but there is a growing chance it
never does. And if it does, this does not herald a
Chinese century as China’s population halves by
2100. If any major middle-income country is truly
outperforming in the coming decades, it’s the
world’s soon-to-be third largest economy (and its
largest democracy), India.

But in terms of leading by example, it’s a radically
different story for the United States. In 1989, the
US was the world’s leading exporter of democracy.
Today, it is the leading exporter of tools that
undermine democracy—the result of algorithms
and social media platforms that rip at the fabric
of civil society while maximizing profit, creating
unprecedented political division, disruption, and

dysfunction. That trend is accelerating fast—not
driven by governments but by a small collection of
individuals with little understanding of the social
and political impact of their actions.

29,"As noted, within the privately held for-profit category, we

captured responses from participants who classified their

respective organizations as either “preparing to become

publicly held” or “no current plans to become publicly held.”

We observed a number of major differences between

these two groups. Across the board, risk scores among

organizations planning to go public are substantially higher

compared with organizations not planning to become

publicly held. For 2023, organizations planning a public

offering rated 35 of the 38 risks at the “Significant Impact”

level. Of note, for those organizations with no plans to

become public companies, only three of 38 risk issues are

rated at the “Significant Impact” level. This is an interesting

distinction, as those companies preparing to go public are

getting ready for increased stakeholder scrutiny and raising

their line of sight on the need for improved infrastructure

in many areas. Thus, as the survey results suggest, their

sensitivity to risk is higher.

For the most part,

macroeconomic and

operational risk concerns

dominate the top five risk

issues for all organizations. ",,0

looking for ways to remain innovative and build a strong, competitive
position for the future.

Some of the specific themes we see playing a critical role in 2023 and
beyond include:

• Leading through macroeconomic uncertainty. Beleaguered
by softening consumer spending, lower product demand, and
falling market capitalizations, tech companies’ C-suites are feeling
the urgency to increase margins and grow revenues. Beyond

workforce adjustments, approaches may include making business
processes more efficient, relying more heavily on intelligent
automation, reducing tech debt by implementing best practices
for software development, modernizing legacy architectures by
migrating to cloud and XaaS, and considering strategic mergers
and acquisitions (M&A).

• Navigating global uncertainties. As technology companies
confront heightened global challenges—including geopolitical
tensions, supply chain volatility, raw material shortages,
semiconductor supply concerns, and new regulations—they
should work to mitigate risks and build more resilient systems.
Leaders should think strategically about their choices of partners,
where they’re located, and where and how production takes place.

• Transforming other industries through technology. On a
hunt for new revenue opportunities, the tech sector is extending
its reach into other industries, using digital advancements to
support innovation and transformation. ",,0

Safeguarding business continuity through securing data, keeping systems online, and
ensuring that computer code functions properly is top of mind for tech companies. But
this would not be possible without the highly skilled tech employees — from cloud security
specialists and security operations to programmers and web developers — who work to keep
systems running efficiently and effectively.

The importance of a strong workforce is highlighted in our survey data. ",,1
33,"Risk in Focus 2023 roundtable participants
agreed it could be difficult to find board
time for IT-related topics, including
cybercrime, despite the fact the pandemic
had pushed digitalisation efforts further
up the agenda. In last year’s Risk in Focus
survey, for example, the threat from
digitalisation ranked third – compared with
fifth this year.

“I participate in both risk and audit
committees,” said one chief audit executive
at a financial services firm, “and while we
talk a lot about lending, compliance and
credit risk, we don’t discuss IT.” That was
left to a separate meeting with the chief
information officer and those in the
second lines.

An internal audit presence at IT security
committees, or with chief information
and security officers24, is effective for
driving better security, but board-level
engagement is key. Chief audit executives
can play a major role in raising awareness
of cyberthreats in board rooms. ",1.0,0
34,"The list of ESG issues companies face is fueling
demand for skills and resources in this area
yet demand far outstrips supply. A lack of
consistent standards and reporting frameworks
has hindered ESG knowledge gathering,
training and certification. It also drives up costs.
However, as ESG becomes more established, a
talent pool will emerge, as will a prioritization of
resources that support sustainability initiatives.

“The sustainability imperative is clear,” says
De Bilio. “Integrating ESG considerations
across all aspects of business has become the
key performance indicator of a company’s
financial health and its ability to meet increasing
stakeholder expectations to support the
transition to a green economy, access capital,
raise financing, meet heightened regulatory
and compliance requirements, and attract and
retain talent.”

Nearly half of respondents cited cyber-security
resilience as their foremost ESG concern in the
Allianz Risk Barometer. For many, the war
in Ukraine has heightened the risk of a largescale cyber-attack, which can have wide ESG
implications, including the failure of a business
to protect its information network, the social
consequences of disrupted supply chains, and
damage to a company’s reputation.

polycrises accelerates

Concurrent shocks, deeply interconnected risks
and eroding resilience are giving rise to the risk of
polycrises – where disparate crises interact such
that the overall impact far exceeds the sum of each
part. Eroding geopolitical cooperation will have ripple
effects across the global risks landscape over the
medium term, including contributing to a potential
polycrisis of interrelated environmental, geopolitical
and socioeconomic risks relating to the supply of and
demand for natural resources.

The report describes four potential futures centred
around food, water and metals and mineral shortages,
all of which could spark a humanitarian as well as an
ecological crisis – from water wars and famines to
continued overexploitation of ecological resources
and a slowdown in climate mitigation and adaption.
Given uncertain relationships between global risks,

bases. This is cited as the fifth-ranked risk issue for 2023.

Increased competition for customers means increased

costs to service customer needs; for example, the number

of retailers rolling out lucrative loyalty programs to attract

consumers continues to grow, despite some challenges

obtaining customer data needed to drive the programs.

Workforce Management

Facing some of the tightest labor markets on record and the prospect of cooling macroeconomic growth,
organizations face competing signals in their workforce planning.

2023 Recommendations for Audit1. Uncertain Talent Needs

2. Uncertain Long-Term Effects of Hybrid Working Models

Key Risk Indicators

• As the global economy heads toward a potential recession, organizations grapple

with uncertainty over when and if to change course on the size, location and

composition of their workforces.

",,0
53,"76,77 Organizations will be challenged to calibrate financial plans to the right

level amid such uncertainty. They would be prudent to prepare for a wide range of

scenarios.

Economic developments in China are also noteworthy. Although the “zero-COVID” policy

was relaxed in December 2022, delays and disruptions throughout 2022 associated with

the policy have contributed to reported annual GDP growth of just 3%, a very low rate in

the Chinese context. 72 Looking ahead, however, the policy change may boost prospects

for growth, with forecasters estimating 5% growth for 2023 and supply chain pressures

improving dramatically. 78 Nonetheless, the end to COVID-19 restrictions does involve

some risk of future outbreaks. This could shift the potential for disruptions to operations

and supply chain from mandated quarantine to high case rates impacting workforces as

well as shoppers. 79

Recommendations for Audit

Assess the Organization’s Preparation for Geopolitical Risks

Evaluate second-line activities for monitoring and assessing geopolitical risks,

including how information is communicated to stakeholders.

■

Review scenario-planning activities such as workshops and tabletop exercises

regarding geopolitical risks to ensure they are held with appropriate frequency

and that documentation shows evidence of thorough, in-depth discussions.

54,"Throughout 2022,

many companies continued transformations accelerated

during the COVID-19 pandemic, even as they faced an

intensifying regulatory environment, geopolitical turmoil

and supply chain disruptions.

Heading into the new year, companies again are adjusting

for more uncertainty and headwinds. The biggest challenges

facing TMT companies include difficulty retaining a

strong workforce, including senior management; fending

off economic headwinds, particularly inflation; ensuring

data security and privacy compliance; and finding people

with the right skillsets to meet the rapid pace of digital

transformation. Additionally, many TMT executives are

concerned about resistance to change within their culture

impacting their business model and core operations.

These concerns represent the top five risks identified by

TMT respondents in this year’s survey. The results indicate

that the TMT industry has shaken off risks related to the

pandemic, but what now prevails in board and C-suite

discussions are concerns related to people management,

which occupy two of the top 10 risks for the industry group.

The “people” problem

The TMT industry has a “people problem” — one that is

complicated by the global economic downturn, disruptive

and fast-paced digital innovation, as well as cultural change.

55,"The center-right government in
Greece should narrowly hold onto power next summer,
while Poland’s euroskeptic government is likely to be
replaced by a liberal, more pro-EU coalition in the fall.

Taiwan crisis
There is growing concern in Washington that the
United States and China are headed for confrontation
over Taiwan … and that it’s increasingly likely China
proactively changes the status quo, possibly even leading
to direct military conflict in the near term. US Secretary
of State Antony Blinken has asserted that China’s Xi is
“determined to pursue reunification on a much faster
timeline” than previously thought. Senior defense officials
have suggested Chinese use of force to retake Taiwan

could happen by 2027, and possibly as soon as this year.
But Taiwan isn’t set to become a crisis in 2023.

Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party could
escalate tensions with Beijing by advocating more overtly
pro-autonomy policies ahead of the 2024 presidential
election—especially now that President Tsai Ing-wen, a
relative moderate on cross-strait issues, has stepped down
as party chair. But last year’s local elections made the
engagement-minded Kuomintang opposition party more,
not less, powerful.

",,0
56,"Deal-making remains
active, with buoyant M&A in areas like infrastructure carve-out and
tower deals. There’s also relatively intense regulatory attention on
the big tech players, coupled with policies supportive of network
infrastructure such as the EU Recovery Fund.

Asia-Pacific:

In Asia-Pacific, the environment for telcos varies by sub-region. China offers strong
prospects for growth, supported by telco listings, while India is seeing revenues recover
but growth rates remain below pre-crisis levels as corporate restructurings continue.
Operators in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are experiencing rising
capital intensity and lower return on invested capital (ROIC), as the mobile revenue mix
shifts heavily toward data. In Oceania, restructurings and tower sales are helping to unlock
value, but there’s growing potential for fixed wireless access (FWA) to compete with
fiber networks.

Latin America:

Compared to other regions, Latin America remains relatively
more insulated from geopolitical risks. The growth opportunity
in FTTH is being supported by infrastructure carve-outs, and 5G
for enterprise is a further focus. Going forward, 5G migration is
set to accelerate in the wake of the national spectrum auctions in
Brazil, Chile and the Dominican Republic.

57,"The demonstrations will accordingly erode what’s left of the
regime’s legitimacy and lead Iran to lash out against countries that support the protesters.

Then there’s the nuclear program. The effort to revive the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and impose
time-limited constraints on Iran’s nuclear development has failed. The mood in Tehran has shifted decisively against
compromise, given the protests and the government’s perception that the deal won’t deliver enough sure benefits.
14 eurasia group  TOP RISKS 2023

Meanwhile, since Biden took office, Iran’s nuclear program
has become both more advanced and less monitored. Iran
announced in November that it would begin producing
near-weapons grade enriched uranium using some of its
most advanced centrifuges at a facility buried deep inside
a mountain, a site impenetrable to all but the biggest
munitions. Iran today can produce enough fissile material
for a nuclear weapon in a matter of weeks—the closest it
has ever been. That poses threats to both the region and
the West.

Iran’s material support for Russia’s war in Ukraine had
added another dimension to its failed relations with the

62,"Developing a more globally consistent taxonomy,
data standards, and legal definition of personal
and sensitive information is a key enabler. These
frameworks should recognize that sensitivity can
rise from data-driven inferences that are enabled
by large data sets, the proliferation of online social
networks, and the blurring of personal and industrial
data in the roll-out of the IOT and implementation of
“smarter” cities.115 For example, one company was
recently fined under the EU’s GDPR (General Data

Historically severe fines for data loss are also

but questions remain around the individual rights
to action, damage and compensation in cases of

consider the ethics of data collection and usage

regulatory compliance. In addition, spurred by both
increased cyberattacks and tighter data laws, the

2022 was another year of global turmoil, with conflict and civil unrest dominating
the news, ensuring political risks and violence ranks as a new entry in the top 10
global risks. Activity is expected to continue in 2023.

While recent protests have disparate causes, they share
common themes, says Srdjan Todorovic, Head of Political
Violence and Hostile Environment Solutions at AGCS.
These include resentment at governments perceived to
ignore the people and their will, groups emboldened to
stand up for their beliefs, empowered unions, and cost-ofliving concerns, leading to desperation and opportunism:
“In countries with wide financial discrepancies, ethnic
issues are on the rise. So is a sense of grievance around
specific events and longer-term systemic injustice.
Environmental issues also come into play. ",,0

report, the impact of these events disproportionately

registered as a top-five risk in 25 countries surveyed
by the EOS, in particular in developing coastal states
across Latin America, Africa and South-East Asia.

As floods, heatwaves, droughts and other extreme
weather events become more severe and frequent,
a wider set of populations will be affected. In
parallel, a consolidation of public- and privatesector resources may set up emerging and pressing
trade-offs between disaster recovery, loss and
damage, adaptation and mitigation. Although climate
mitigation has been overwhelmingly favoured over
adaptation in terms of financing to date, particularly
in the private sector,38 EOS results indicate that
climate adaptation may now be seen as a more
immediate concern in the short term by business
leaders. Failure of climate change mitigation only
featured in the top five risks over the next two years
in one economy, Zambia, whereas the Failure of
climate-change adaptation was a top-five risk

expensive energy imports and face surging borrowing
costs to fill the hole, resulting in energy shortages and
social discontent. Angry over having to shoulder costs
for sanctions on Russia they didn’t agree to, emerging
markets will chip away at the Western sanctions regime
by continuing to trade with Russia. Two of the world’s
three biggest energy consumers, China and India, will
continue to buy large quantities of Russian crude at a
steep discount. The United States will respond by hitting
some emerging markets (albeit not China or India) with
secondary sanctions, further inflaming tensions between
industrialized economies and emerging markets already
rocked by high inflation (please see risk #4), the war in
Ukraine, the Covid-19 pandemic, and climate change.

countries represent 18% of the global population
and account for more than 50% of people living in
extreme poverty.130 Fears of contagion and further
capital flight could weaken debt sustainability in a
growing number of lower-income countries. The
scale of debt defaults will influence the depth of
available restructuring, with some creditor countries
hesitant to bail out distressed states on sufficiently
concessionary terms, due to their own tightening
fiscal space and rising domestic needs. There may
also be a shift away from overseas development
assistance towards loans to continue to support
development and wield economic power. This has
a lower domestic cost but exacerbates the debt
burden on these markets and increases the risk of a
larger wave of defaults in the future.

It is not only the scale but the complexity of potential
debt restructuring and need for global cooperation
that will determine the extent to which defaults can
be contained (Figure 2.10). Creditors have expanded

staff engagement rank as the second top ESG risk trend
of most concern to companies (40%) behind only cyber

shifted the social contract between employers and their

broad set of labor and employment issues, ranging from
health and safety to wellbeing and diversity, while being
accountable for driving societal impact, environmental
stability and inclusive growth (see ESG top risk concerns

Another consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic and rising
wage inflation is a shortage of skilled workforce. Many
countries have experienced a reduction in the available
workforce at a time of high demand for labor, as some
workers took early retirement. And while the cost-of-living
crisis may see some of these people return, at the end of
2022 it was reported that there were almost two unfilled

2022 Update
Executive Summary

We are pleased to present the 2022 update of our Emerging Risk Radar.

Emerging Risks are risks which may newly develop or which already exist and are

continuously evolving. They are characterized by a high degree of uncertainty

in terms of impacts and likelihood and have a substantial potential impact on

Insurance business lines, investment classes and/or operations.

The Radar is a summary of emerging risks and associated major trends that could

affect the insurance sector over the next five years and beyond. Risks are classified

low, medium or high according to their perceived materiality. Both the list of risks

and the assessment of impact and timing are based on the expert opinion of the

Emerging Risk Initiative (ERI) working group of the CRO Forum.

The main trends have been assessed and updated as part of working group

sessions. The “Consumer Behavior Digitization” is merged to “Demographic

and Social Change”. ",,0

For the second consecutive year, anticipated increases

in labor costs and how this may affect opportunities to

achieve profitability targets ranks as the number two risk

in the survey. Labor costs already account for a sizable

portion of most healthcare organizations’ operating

expenses — about 40-60%, depending on an organization’s

size and complexity. Since the onset of the pandemic,

staffing models implemented as short-term solutions

leveraged significant use of overtime and temporary

staffing, both of which are extremely expensive. Given

organizations have with government and private payers,

there is limited opportunity for healthcare organizations

to recover their increasing labor costs, at least in the

short term. ",,0

Signposts for the future

2023 technology industry outlook

As 2023 dawns, the technology industry is struggling with uneven
demand, right-sizing and right-skilling of its workforce, and uncertainty
on a global scale.

Modernizing legacy IT, adopting state-of-the-art
software engineering practices, and shifting some
processes to cloud may help organizations streamline
operations, reduce costs, and improve compliance
with new regulations. These strategic moves could
position tech companies well to expand into adjacent
industries when opportunities arise.

In the coming year, tech companies should be on
the lookout for potential signals of change in the
market, including:

• Changing macroeconomic conditions—whether
weakening or improving—that may impact product
and service choices, workforce decisions, and
business model choices.

• Opportunities to grow or streamline—for example,
making strategic M&A decisions or divesting
noncore assets.

• Activity around technology/health care convergence,
including acquisitions, partnerships, and significant
new tech upgrades and enhancements to
established health and wellness products.

• Increased M&A activity among health care, tech, and
sustainability companies.

• Changes in due diligence concerns for targeted M&A
efforts in the tech industry.

Three-year comparison of risks
Each year, we provide an analysis of the overall three-year

trends for the risks surveyed to provide insights about

trending of individual risks. As discussed previously, to help

identify differences in risk concerns across respondent type,

we group all the risks based on their average scores into one

of three classifications. Consistent with our prior studies,

we use the following color-coding scheme to highlight risks

visually using these three categories.

In Table 3, we summarize the impact assessments for each

of the 38 risks for the full sample arranged by the three

categories of risks we analyze: macroeconomic, strategic and

operational. For each risk, the column labeled “2023 Rank”

indicates that risk’s relative position among the 38 risks for

2023, with rank “1” representing the risk with the highest

overall impact score for 2023.

data is coming under increasing pressure by
national security concerns, combining the protection

Commercialized privacy

The right to privacy as it applies to information about
individuals incorporates two key elements: the right
not to be observed and the right to control the flow
of information when observed.86 As more data is
collected and the power of emerging technologies
increases over the next decade, individuals will be
targeted and monitored by the public and private
sector to an unprecedented degree, often without
adequate anonymity or consent.87

Surveillance technologies are becoming increasingly

sophisticated through new technologies and
techniques for gathering and analyzing data. The
oft-cited examples are biometric identification
technologies. In recognition of the potential risks
posed to privacy and the freedom of movement,
some companies have self-regulated the sale of
facial recognition to law enforcement, and the use of
this technology in public spaces faces an upcoming
ban in the EU.88 Concerns also extend to the use
of biometric technologies to analyze emotions.

components and seek to ensure a continuous supply. One way
to potentially make the entire supply chain more resilient is to
explore the possibility of a merger or a joint venture with domestic
manufacturers, mitigating the adverse impact of market uncertainties

Strategic questions to consider:

• How will our tech company manage our
existing deals with Chinese companies,

• How can we reduce our reliance on Asian

CLIMATE, GEOPOLITICS AND ENERGY – A NEW NEXUS OF RISK 2 22 / AXA FUTURE RISKS REPORT 2022
After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, some commentators predicted
that the sustainability agenda would be overshadowed by
concern about this crisis and possible future conflicts. The fact
that both experts and the general population put climate change
in first place does not bear out this idea, but nonetheless
geopolitical tensions rose rapidly up the rankings: among experts
they jumped from 4th to 2nd position, and among the general
public from 9th to 3rd.

Experts are even more worried than the general public about
the potential for tensions to escalate further, in Europe
and beyond. ",,1
102,"There has been a noticeable shift
towards non-communicable diseases over the past
decade (Figure 2.5), linked to population growth
and ageing alongside lagging coverage by health
systems. A key implication is the resulting loss of
functional health and rise in disabilities, rather than
deaths. Medical advances have made it possible
for people to live with multiple co-morbidities
(such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease
and depression), but these remain complex and
expensive to manage. People are living more years
in poor health, and we may soon face a more
sustained reversal in life expectancy gains beyond
the influence of the pandemic.

Notably, although some disease burdens are
growing, all health-related risks fell into roughly
the bottom third of the GRPS’ global risk rankings
over both the two- and 10-year period (Figure

“Finding alternative suppliers is just a first
step, not the final solution,” adds Pachov. “If
alternative suppliers are not secured with proper
engagement and contractual terms, in times of
crisis or peak demand, suppliers can pick and
choose which clients to serve, or increase price
and lead times, creating uncertainty.”

Despite such progress, many companies have
yet to improve supply chain transparency or are
unable to provide good quality data or engage
with the relevant stakeholders to obtain it. This
is usually due to a lack of awareness among
companies that have not experienced disruption
and still see this as a remote possibility.

“But when disruption happens it can have
catastrophic consequences, which is why
insurers and brokers must continue to bring
knowledge and raise awareness for companies
and clients, given the growing connectivity
between many organizations,” says Pachov.

106,"From here, organizations can take a scenario-based approach to assess their security,
controls, compliance, and operational resilience to determine effective risk transfer and
mitigation techniques. Consider also where there are interrelated risks and risks that may
have multiple potential insurance policy responses.

Although the risks ranked highest on this year’s survey are concerning, organizations
operating in this space should especially consider their counterparty risks, a significant risk
since most companies are not building their own digital asset infrastructure.

Organizations will also need to think about their regulatory risks and consider how potential
regulations may affect them and change their objectives.

Regulatory clarity is likely to be helpful from a corporate governance perspective; however, as
regulations and categorizations of digital assets evolve, more complex challenges may arise.
Currently, courts and regulators struggle with how to define digital assets, as currencies,
commodities, securities, or something else entirely. How these assets are classified ultimately
determines which laws and bodies have purview over their regulation. As situations evolve,

organizations using digital assets in house will need to review whether they are able to handle
any added regulatory responsibilities, or if they need to partner with a third party to continue
business in this space.

resources has had a significant inflationary impact on
the global economy. As prices rise and central banks
maintain tight monetary policy to counteract the trend,
energy uncertainty will be a drag on economies, some
still in recovery post-Covid.

We also see a scenario or ‘cluster’ within the network
in #1 Rogue Russia, #2 [China influence], and #3
Weapons of Mass Disruption. These risks are bidirectionally inter-connected and presage another
potentially high-risk, rapid (six-month velocity), and
catastrophic scenario. This highlights the combined
risk severity of the Russian government’s ongoing war
in Ukraine and possible escalation with the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), China's
influence on the global economy (especially as it
reopens its doors after shifting its Zero-COVID
strategy), and the disruptive nature of new
technologies like generative Artificial Intelligence (AI).

In terms of business focus, addressing the most
‘contagious’ risks, or most influential, can help isolate
the potential impact of other risks further down the
contagion scale. Some of these risks can be actively
managed. ",,0

report also draws on the World Economic Forum’s
Executive Opinion Survey (EOS) to identify risks
that pose the most severe threat to each country
over the next two years, as identified by over
12,000 business leaders in 121 economies. When
considered in context with the GRPS, this data
provides insight into local concerns and priorities
and points to potential “hot spots” and regional
manifestations of global risks. Refer to Appendix
B: Executive Opinion Survey: National Risk
Perceptions for more detail.

Finally, the report integrates the views of leading
experts to generate foresight and to support
analysis of the survey data. The Global Risks Report
harnesses contributions from over 40 colleagues
across the World Economic Forum’s platforms.
Qualitative insights were also collected from over
50 experts from across academia, business,
government, the international community and
civil society through community meetings, private
interviews and thematic workshops conducted from

Industry analysis

The Financial Services and Energy and Utilities industry groups both expect modest reductions in the level of investment

in 2023 relative to 2022. This may simply reflect the increased investments already made in 2022 as indicated in last year’s

numbers. The Consumer Products and Services industry group leads in both absolute terms for 2023 (7.02) and in the

magnitude of the increase from 2022 expectations (an increase of 0.73). The Manufacturing and Distribution, Technology,

Media and Telecommunications, and Healthcare industry groups all indicate a higher likelihood to invest more in risk

management capabilities in 2023 relative to 2022.

For businesses, protests in liberal democracies are

In more autocratic jurisdictions, protests can be more
problematic and escalate into broader political

volatility and disruption in the business operating

continue to disappoint.

If a recession does occur, a softening labor market will
also make talent acquisition and retention difficult, just
as our biggest working generation, the baby boomers,
retires. Real wages are falling in many countries Brazil, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, the UK, and the

132,"Generative AI will make it difficult for businesses and
investors to distinguish between genuine engagement
and sentiment on the one hand, and sabotage attempts by
hackers, activist investors, or corporate rivals on the other,
with material implications for their bottom lines. Citizen
activists, trolls, and anyone in-between will be able to cause
corporate crises by generating large enough volumes of
high-quality tweets, product reviews, online comments, and
letters to executives to simulate mass movements in public
opinion. AI-generated content amplified by social media
will overwhelm high-frequency trading and sentimentdriven investment strategies, with market-moving effects.

Of course, AI also offers incredible productivity gains
that we’ve only just begun to appreciate (if this wasn’t our
Top Risks report, we’d be writing more about them). But
that’s the thing with revolutionary technologies, from the
printing press to nuclear fission and the internet—their
power to drive human progress is matched by their ability
to amplify humanity’s most destructive tendencies. The
former is embraced and promoted; the latter downplayed
and usually ignored … until there’s a crisis.

Organizations planning for the possibility of a recession also face mixed signals.

Throughout 2022, many thought a recession was looming, especially in light of

contractionary monetary policies pursued by central banks worldwide to combat inflation

(though the Bank of Japan is a notable exception to this trend). 71 Reality has yet to catch

up to these predictions, as the EU and U.S. posted 2022 GDP growth of 3.5% and 2.1%,

respectively, and U.S. unemployment hit 53-year lows. 72,65 The International Monetary

Fund revised its 2023 global growth projections up 0.2 percentage points to 2.9% in its

January update to the World Economic Outlook. 73 The proportion of private sector

economists predicting a recession has fallen from 64% to about 50% in the National

Association for Business Economics’ quarterly Business Conditions Survey, and there is

renewed speculation about the possibility of a “soft landing.” 74,75

On the other hand, the global financial system has undergone significant turmoil recently,

beginning with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in the U.S.,

followed by the acquisition of Credit Suisse by UBS with the support of the Swiss

government. ",,0
134,"Other issues, though not ranked among the top five risk

concerns for these organizations, still represent significant

priorities, such as organizational culture, operating

successfully amid shifts to hybrid work environments or

remote work arrangements, and resistance to change in

these and other areas that could impact the organization’s

ability to achieve its long-term objectives. It’s also

important to note that most of these risk issues fall under

the umbrella of ongoing innovation and transformation

efforts as manufacturing and distribution organizations

continue to go through the growing pains of Industry 4.0.

Overview of top risk issues in 2023

Organizations in the Manufacturing and Distribution

industry group reflect trends in their assessment of the

risk landscape for 2023 similar to that of most other

organizations worldwide. They view the risk landscape

to be riskier for the next 12 months compared with their

perceptions in last year’s survey for 2022. Ratings for

three of the top five risk issues for the industry group

have increased year-over-year, with the fifth-ranked

risk issue being new to this year’s survey: uncertainties

from reliance on international markets for key elements

of the supply chain creating significant challenges. ",,0
135,"– Understand the talent and skills required for the

organization to achieve its strategy as the economy

recovers.

– Focus on workforce reductions that eliminate

overlaps in skills and capabilities.

– Consider third-party resources to provide certain

skills.

– Explore opportunities to eliminate jobs that can

be displaced by technology with the attendant

workforce reskilling and upskilling.

• Build a resilient culture. Inculcate a philosophy of

embracing change.

• Integrate upskilling and retention strategies. Ensure

the organization’s investments in upskilling employees

are fully realized.

• Make succession planning a strategic priority. This

needs to happen beyond the senior executive suite.

Devise and test knowledge transfer processes and

leadership development plans to increase flexibility

and reduce the high costs and stress associated with

reassigning roles and responsibilities in a reactive

manner. Consider how the organization is going to retain

its key people and keep them engaged long-term to

increase the strength of the executive bench.

• Keep DEI and ESG top of mind. Monitor employee

sentiment on DEI and other ESG matters to identify and

assess the broad range of human capital risks to inform

decision-making processes on taking corporate stances

on contentious issues. ",,0

surprisingly, perhaps, this year internal
auditors ranked it as the 5th biggest risk
their organisations faced. With 38% citing
it a top five risk this year compared to 45%
last year.

Internal auditors said they expected to
spend an increasing amount of time on the
issue so that in three years’ time it will rank
as the 2nd biggest area for internal audit
effort in terms of time spent, according
to the Risk in Focus 2023 survey. But with
rocketing inflation, pressure to increase
pay and supply chain disruption, it may be
that in 2023 many businesses do not have
the funds to carry out these plans.

Organisations are naturally at different
levels of maturity with their innovation
strategies - from having basic networked
computers to being digital-first businesses

While internal auditors are turning their attention to artificial intelligence systems, they must also ensure that their
organisations have got the basics right for digitalisation.

Economic forecasts predict slowdowns in hiring and the potential for greater

unemployment, as high inflation puts pressure on household spending and central banks

have raised interest rates to combat rising prices. 1 Some organizations have begun to lay

off workers, but overall labor market conditions remain tight for now. Our recent survey of

HR leaders found that 48% of respondents’ organizations had slowed hiring, and 33% had

frozen it for at least some roles, in response to prevailing economic activity. However, the

same survey found that, as of January 2023, 50% of organizations expect to see an

increase in competition for talent in the next six months, up from 35% in December

Smaller companies increasingly

Recent years have seen more large businesses and
corporations boosting their investment in cyber security
tools as awareness has increased and cyber risk
has become a boardroom topic and a management
responsibility. An unexpected consequence of this trend is
that the number of small- and mid-size businesses being
impacted by a cyber incident is growing as those with
weak controls are easily hit by hackers in search of ‘low
hanging fruit’ – bringing financial rewards for little effort,
according to Sabrina Sexton, Head of Global Cyber
SME and Mid-Corporate, Cyber Center of Competence
at Allianz.

The consequences for these firms are often much
more severe given the lack of financial and employee
resources that they have access to compared with large
corporations. During 2021, the FBI’s Internet Crime
Complaint Center received 847,376 complaints regarding
cyber-attacks and malicious cyber activity with nearly
$7bn in losses5, the majority of which had targeted
small businesses.

On the audit committee’s agenda
2023: The year of the risk-centric agenda

January 2023

The audit committee’s role in risk oversight
Predicting the future is difficult, particularly in times of change and
uncertainty. However, it seems safe to predict that the 2023 agendas
of many audit committees will be risk-centric.

Of course, risk oversight is among the most important—if not
the most important—of the audit committee’s responsibilities.
While the audit committee is not responsible for overseeing all
of a company’s risks, it is often responsible for oversight of the
company’s risk oversight policies and processes, principally the
enterprise risk program. This program, which management leads,
entails identifying key risks across the organization, from financial
risks to workforce risks and from risks due to raw material shortages
to risks arising from natural disasters and other crises. In other
words, except in cases where a company has a risk committee,1 the
audit committee oversees the process of evaluating and managing
risks that could pose a threat to the company’s viability and success.

Our survey was conducted online in September and

October of 2022 to capture perspectives on risks on

the minds of executives as they peered into 2023. Each

respondent was asked to rate 38 individual risk issues in

defend Taiwan against a Chinese attack, casting doubt
on Washington’s longstanding commitment to “strategic
ambiguity.” But while the US will seek to improve political
and economic ties with Taiwan, as well as military
deterrence against any potential Chinese attack, the White
House isn’t considering a formalized security guarantee—
let alone crossing Beijing’s redline of recognizing Taiwan
as a sovereign state.

A more hawkish, Republican-controlled House will
advance proposals to weaken or even abandon the United
States’s One China policy, but the real momentum is
behind symbolic shows of support such as congressional
visits to Taiwan and diplomatic engagements like the 21st
Century Trade Initiative. Importantly, neither US private
sector nor US allies want to risk a crisis.

For its part, China will match Taiwanese and American
“provocations” with strong rhetoric and posturing of its
own, and there may be more frequent military exercises
and activities around Taiwan that prove disruptive to
shipping and global supply chains. But Xi has recently
reaffirmed Beijing’s longstanding policy of prioritizing
“peaceful unification” over the long term.

In the face of vulnerabilities highlighted by the
pandemic and then war, economic policy, particularly
in advanced economies, is increasingly directed
towards geopolitical goals. Countries are seeking
to build “self-sufficiency”, underpinned by state aid,
and achieve “sovereignty” from rival powers, through
onshoring and “friend-shoring” global supply chains.
Defensive measures to boost local production and
minimize foreign interference in critical industries
include subsidies, tighter investment screening,
data localization policies, visa bans and exclusion of
companies from key markets.

While initially driven by tensions between the United
States of America and China, many policies are
extra-territorial in nature or have been similarly
adopted by other markets, with spill-over effects
across a broad range of industries. For example,
Switzerland is considering the introduction of a
general cross-sectoral foreign direct investment
screening regime for the first time. Expanded state
aid to support self-sufficiency in “strategically

""Which five risks are the most likely to pose the biggest threat to your country in the next two years?""2023   17
The IMF’s most recent projections anticipate a
decline in global inflation from almost 9% in 2022
to 6.5% this year and 4.1% in 2024, with a sharper
disinflation in advanced economies.16 However,
downside risks to the outlook loom large. The
complexity of inflationary dynamics is creating a
challenging policy environment for both the public
sector and central banks, given the mix of demand
and supply-side drivers, including a prolonged war
in Ukraine and associated energy-supply crunch,
potential for escalating sanctions, and continued
bottlenecks from a lingering pandemic or new
sources of supply-side controls.

Given currently low headline unemployment in
advanced economies, persistent price pressures will
likely lead to higher interest rates to avoid inflation
de-anchoring. Central banks have sped up the postpandemic normalization of monetary policy. ",,0
162,"Yet
the rapid expansion of green infrastructure in a
quest for energy security may have unintended
impacts on domestic and broader ecosystems,
as the dependencies on and risks to natural
ecosystems of these technologies are, presently,
less well understood. Although renewable energy
infrastructure can be “nature-positive” – for example,
wind farms acting as a “safe haven” for the recovery
of marine populations and the seabed – green
sources of energy can also cause environmental
degradation, such as habitat loss, sound and
electromagnetic pollution, introduction of nonindigenous species and changes to animal migratory
patterns.19

Renewable energy technologies are also reliant
on non-renewable, abiotic natural capital (metals
and minerals, as explored in Chapter 3: Resource
Rivalries). These are sourced from the geosphere,
which, together with the hydrosphere, provide the
physical habitat for the global ecosystem. These
resources are often concentrated in countries with
poor governance of nascent, artisanal and illicit
mining, or less stringent environmental and social
regulations – increasing the likelihood of more
widespread destruction of nature and devastation of
local communities and indigenous groups. ",,1
163,"For example,
Brazil has scaled lithium, rare earth elements and
nickel production, but has remained dependent
on others for refining and on neighbours for other
resources such as copper and cobalt.26 The EU and
Canada have continued their Strategic Partnership
on Raw Materials, extending the scope of the
agreement beyond the development and financing
of critical mineral projects to increased collaboration
on related technologies.27

Yet resource nationalism has also driven cracks
in existing alliances – becoming the next Airbus
vs. Boeing – with disputes arising first around the
application of state aid to boost domestic mining
and processing industries. The expanding use of
the national security exemption at the WTO has also
increasingly paralysed multilateral trade mechanisms,
rendering them ineffective in addressing geopolitical
confrontation in a world where local resilience and
security is prioritized over comparative advantage
and efficiency. Bilateral mechanisms are elevated in
importance as the primary vehicle for disputes.

INSIGHTS

Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, higher food
prices have begun to alarm consumers even in wealthy
countries. Food inflation is an even more serious
concern in lower and middle-income states, where
households spend on average 30-40% of their income on
food. About 1.2 billion people were food-insecure at the
end of 2021(9). By mid-May 2022, that had increased to
1.6 billion, and this figure is expected to continue to rise.

",,0
165,"Their trajectories are,
to varying degrees, increasingly unsustainable.

More broadly, progress in human development has
been thrown into reverse by a global pandemic, a
land war in Europe, a massive inflationary shock,
and mounting climate catastrophe. After decades
of globalization pushing unprecedented global
growth and the emergence of a robust global
middle class, we are now seeing a majority of the
world’s 8 billion people fare worse, not better, in
education levels, life expectancy, economic wellbeing, and safety and security. The headwinds for
human development will grow in 2023.

American leadership is a double-edged sword.
One year into Russia’s failed war, the United

Avoiding such export bans is one step policymakers can
take to mitigate food security risks, as part of open trade

national food stocks. More effective food aid should be
provided to lower-income countries, particularly those

Inflation is eroding people’s purchasing power: in the United
States, for example, inflation reached 9.1% in June, and in
the UK, it reached 10.1% in August – in both cases, the highest in
the last 40 years. In this year’s survey, experts included monetary
and fiscal policy risks in the top 10 for the first time. When asked
why they chose this risk, 66% cited concern that ineffective
monetary policy might lead to hyperinflation.

Our survey respondents worry that persistent inflation could
lead to social unrest and riots. The International Monetary Fund
warned in April about possible riots in Southern Africa(6), while
the United Nations expects food security to worsen into 2023(7)
and has warned that no country is immune to social erosion
caused by rising prices of basic commodities. Several developing
countries already experienced “food riots” due to volatile prices
in the mid-2000s(8).

over time, competition in the labor market should pressure organizations to list more

meaningful ranges. Transparency in salaries for new job postings could also spur existing

employees to look for divergences from their own compensation levels and demand

equity. In some cases, organizations could face legal risk of claims of pay discrimination.

Pressure on employers to offer higher salaries will be compounded if a proposed Federal

Trade Commission (FTC) rule banning noncompetes takes effect in the U.S. 16 The FTC

estimates that eliminating noncompetes would impact approximately 30 million workers

(about 18% of the U.S. workforce) and increase workers’ earnings by nearly $300 billion. 17

Organizations currently using noncompetes would be required to rescind them for existing

employees if the rule is adopted. In its current form, though, the rule would leave in place

any provisions negotiated in exchange for the noncompete. 18

Another heightened year

2023 is likely to be another heightened year for BI and
supply chain disruption, as companies navigate uncertain
geopolitical, economic and climate risks, as well as
long-term transformations, namely digitalization and
decarbonization, according to Georgi Pachov, Head of
Portfolio Steering & Pricing at AGCS.

“Businesses are now more vulnerable following recent
macroeconomic turmoil and the war in Ukraine, which
triggered shortages and price increases in energy, food
and certain raw materials. The conflict added further
pressure to supply chains already struggling with
post-pandemic disruption, such as shortages in semiconductors, which have yet to fully recover.

“How the war in Ukraine evolves, whether it ends

disruptions going forward. ",,0
192,"The advent of the use of smartphones
together with discussions taking place on
social media has made such an attitude
untenable, not least because every key

Organisations can use the UN Sustainable
Development Goals as a starting point
for their ESG ambitions and work back
from there to consider how that impacts
their own purpose and goals. Internal
auditors can use that project to speak to

a wide array of stakeholders, which will
help inform the company of the specific
social context in which they are operating.
In fact, the EU’s pandemic recovery plan

to underline the importance of ESG in
corporate governance since it is built on
the UN’s goals. NextGenerationEU is highly
focused on climate change, biodiversity
and gender equality to build a more
equitable Europe in the wake
of the pandemic.

Investing in multi-domain,

In addition, actions taken to address current
challenges should, at a minimum, avoid exacerbating
future risks, such as the potential trade-off between
food security, nature loss and climate change.
Recent crises have seen an extraordinary level
of fiscal intervention to protect individuals and
companies from the financial impacts of crises –
from the COVID-19 pandemic to energy prices.
While necessary and perhaps unavoidable in the
circumstances at hand, it remains to be seen how
significantly these rapid, large-scale actions will
result in debt sustainability concerns and how widely
they distracted decision-makers from other risks
highlighted in this report.

Conversely, many shorter-term actions can also act
as wider stabilizers, embedding and accelerating

longer-term, multi-domain resilience. ",,0

widespread, historically high levels of public and

turbulent 2020s.

The path to 20251.2

The complex and rapid evolution of the global risks
landscape is adding to a sense of unease. More than
four in five GRPS respondents anticipated consistent
volatility over the next two years at a minimum, with
multiple shocks accentuating divergent trajectories
(Figure 1.10).

Respondents to the GRPS see the path to 2025
dominated by social and environmental risks,
driven by underlying geopolitical and economic
trends (Figure 1.2).

There were some notable differences between the
responses of government and business respondents,
with “Debt crises”, “Failure to stabilize price
trajectories”, “Failure to mitigate climate change”
and “Failure of climate change adaptation”
featuring more prominently for governments, and
“Widespread cybercrime and cyber insecurity” and
“Large-scale environmental damage incidents”
featuring higher for business (Figure 1.3).

costs may hinder growth or impact margins, and (3) concerns that economic conditions (and

inflationary pressures) in markets served may affect growth and profitability. ",,0

some of these risks are likely to intensify in the coming years, the mobility industry broadly
is undergoing a structural shift, which will require companies to think differently about

Root Causes Potential Consequences

Unanticipated Credit Crunch

The cost of borrowing increases beyond anticipated levels

either due to interest rate rises or depreciation of corporate

credit.

Demand Uncertainty

The extent of interest rate hikes or their effects on

macroeconomic demand is difficult to forecast, as is how long

those effects will last.

Investor Caution

Concerns over the banking system coupled with uncertainty

around recession cause investors to reevaluate financial

exposure and risks.

Risk Exposure
Overzealous Cost Cutting

Organizations make cuts that harm strategy execution or

otherwise overcorrect in response to economic indicators,

harming future growth.

Overinvestment or Underinvestment

Underfunding growth investments, ceding market share to

competitors. Alternatively, organizations may incur risk to cash

flows by spending too much.

Rapidly Outdated Cash-Flow Forecasts

Cash flow may change rapidly with fast-moving markets,

creating differences between forecasted and actual cash

positions.

respondents to estimate the likely impact
(severity) for each of the 32 global risks, on a
1-7 scale [1 – Low severity, 7 – High severity],

Respondents were asked to evaluate the
severity, considering the impact on populations,

any other risk considered missing from the 32

leaders feeling more confident that their companies can

respond promptly and effectively to intensifying and

evolving regulatory demands — at least in the near term.

(“Regulatory changes and scrutiny” ranks seventh among

the industry’s top risks for 2032.)Many energy and utilities companies have spent the

past year, or even longer in some cases, looking inward

to determine how they can be more resilient and agile

overall. Improving management of regulatory risks has

been part of that effort. We’ve also seen leading companies

ramping up their monitoring and compliance efforts to

meet increasing environmental, social and governance

(ESG) demands. Those efforts have improved their ability

to respond to future regulatory changes, including climate
related disclosures, and their executive leadership no doubt

return to a “new normal” following the COVID-19
pandemic was quickly disrupted by the outbreak of
war in Ukraine, ushering in a fresh series of crises in
food and energy – triggering problems that decades
of progress had sought to solve.

As 2023 begins, the world is facing a set of risks
that feel both wholly new and eerily familiar. We have
seen a return of “older” risks – inflation, cost-of-living
crises, trade wars, capital outflows from emerging
markets, widespread social unrest, geopolitical
confrontation and the spectre of nuclear warfare –
which few of this generation’s business leaders and
public policy-makers have experienced. These are
being amplified by comparatively new developments
in the global risks landscape, including unsustainable
levels of debt, a new era of low growth, low global
investment and de-globalization, a decline in human

development after decades of progress,  rapid and
unconstrained development of dual-use (civilian and
military) technologies, and the growing pressure of
climate change impacts and ambitions in an evershrinking window for transition to a 1.5°C world.

executive groups whose overall outlook about the risk

environment is lower for 2023 relative to 2022. The key

insight is that there are varying views across different

executive groups about the overall risk environment. As

a generalization, those roles that tend to seek a balance

between opportunity-seeking behavior and establishing

appropriate boundaries and controls are expressing the

highest levels of concern.

• There is marked contrast in perspectives about specific

risk concerns across the various positions. This suggests

there may be significant value in explicit discussions

With tightening credit and financial conditions at a time of
still-high inflation, households and companies will feel the
pinch. Wary of adding fuel to the inflation fire and facing
rising interest costs, policymakers in credit-worthy advanced
economies will try to absorb the income risk for households
and relieve cost pressures on businesses through costly
energy market interventions and subsidies financed by
public debt. But in some advanced economies such as the
United Kingdom and Italy, and in most developing markets,
comprehensive and long-lasting fiscal support measures will
be too expensive. As a result, households and companies will
see their real incomes erode.

The combination of high inflation, rising interest rates, and
insufficient fiscal support will push the global economy
into recession. The global downturn will be compounded
by uncertainty in China’s economic rebound post-zero
Covid (please see risk #2) and Europe’s painful transition

margins — and disappointment for many healthcare

executives trying to achieve profitability targets.

Unlike other industries, which have utilized advances in

technology and process optimization to reduce the cost of

labor as a percentage of expense, the provision and delivery

of healthcare is still very much a labor-intensive service.

The macroeconomic factors driving increases in anticipated

labor costs include inflation (see below), shortages of

clinical and nonclinical workers, and continued fierce

competition for healthcare workers with in-demand skills.

In addition to the economic drivers for wage increases,

issues covered above such as burnout, decreased job

Top risks for small- and mid-size
companies

Smaller companies lack the financial and
employee resources of large corporations with
IT security often outsourced. Many continue
to be under the misconception that cyberattacks won’t happen to them but as more
large businesses ramp up their investments
in cyber security tools, more poorly protected
smaller companies are being exploited. Smaller
companies can be exposed to supply chain
attacks in particular, given they often purchase
software program licenses of much larger
organizations or vendors.

Collectively, small- and mid-size companies
account for half of Allianz Risk Barometer
responses (1,400+). For mid-size companies
business interruption (including supply chain
disruption) maintains its position as the top risk
year-on-year (35%). For small-size companies,
cyber incidents maintains its position as the top
risk as well (31%). Both business interruption
(BI) and cyber rank as a top three risk in
each segment.

For both small- and mid-size companies the
cyber risk situation has changed significantly in
the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Many had
to quickly digitalize their businesses or enable
remote working. ",1.0,0

an IPO are mostly concerned about risks related to

sustaining customer loyalty, the entrance of new

competitors, economic conditions, and lack of sufficient

digital knowledge and proficiencies. In contrast, not
for-profit and governmental entities looking a decade

out are most concerned about regulatory changes and

increased scrutiny and ensuring privacy and security.

Plans to improve risk management
capabilities

In addition to asking respondents to rate each of the 38

risks for 2023 and 2032, we asked them to provide insights

about plans to enhance their organization’s risk management

capabilities in the coming year. Here are some key insights:

• In light of the finding that respondents note an increase

in their impressions about the magnitude and severity of

overall risks for 2023 relative to the prior year, they also

indicate a higher likelihood of deploying more resources

to risk management in 2023 relative to 2022 (and 2021).

This result is not too surprising, especially considering

the past two years of pandemic-related risk concerns

shining the spotlight on the importance of resilience in

the face of unexpected events.

– 77% vs 69% – to fear a new era of war.

Similarly, 95% of experts expect geopolitical tensions to become
more persistent and 94% expect them to spread around
the world. In the UK especially, experts are pessimistic – almost
all of them worried about the global spread of tensions.

When asked what aspect of geopolitical instability most concerns
them, both experts and the general public were most likely
to cite resurgence of military conflicts. Nuclear threats worried
the public more than experts (23% vs 13%), and experts being
more likely to cite supply chain disruptions (18% vs 13%).

However, even options that rank relatively low on this question

Credit Crunch

Continued credit tightening may cause vendors to suspend

operations or become insolvent as borrowing costs increase.

Unexpected Drop in Demand

An unexpected drop in demand may affect vendor viability, or

their ability to provide goods and services in a timely manner

as vendors curtail production and costs.

Continued Inflation

Inflation that is less responsive to interest rate hikes or that

continues over a long duration may escalate costs and margin

pressures on third parties.

Risk Exposure
Flawed Financial Planning Assumptions

Cost assumptions are rendered invalid as suppliers increase

prices or fail, necessitating switching costs and increased

prices for obtaining goods and services.

Loss of Key Inputs and Materials

Losing out on key inputs and materials to others that are

Executive summary
This year's survey reveals interesting perceptions of

executives and directors regarding the current and long
term business environment. Key takeaways to consider

include:

Global marketplace risks are the highest in more than a

decade. Risks across the board have elevated this year in our

survey. For 2023, all but three risks were ranked higher this

year versus last year. For 2032, only a single risk was deemed

to be a lower threat a decade from now, relative to concerns

reported in last year’s report.

Shifts in risks in the short-term versus long-term demand

balancing near- and long-term priorities. There are

noticeable differences in the top risks lists for 2023 and

2032. Merely focusing on near-term risks will inadequately

Insolvency outlook

Inflationary pressures, monetary tightening, the energy
crisis and supply chain disruptions are jeopardizing
corporates’ cash flows. But many governments decided
to tackle the current situation by deploying some strong
fiscal policies. Will these measures be enough to contain
a sharp increase in insolvencies at both global and
local levels?

After two years of decline, a broad-based acceleration
is expected, according to Allianz Trade. Global business
insolvencies should rise in 2023 (+19%), after +10% in
2022, a significant rebound which may bring global
insolvencies back above their pre-pandemic levels by the
end of the year (by +2%) it predicts.

(the lower house of the US Congress), Nancy Pelosi, in August. China’s countermeasures have included
live-fire military exercises in and around Taiwan’s territorial waters. The US government has reiterated
that its diplomatic approach towards Taiwan has not changed, but China is increasingly sceptical of
US-Taiwan relations, particularly given the acute hostility towards China in the US Congress. The risk of
a full military invasion is mitigated by China’s reliance on Taiwan’s semiconductors and concerns about
the US’s active response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. However, recent military exercises by China
and a more aggressive Taiwanese response raise the risk of a miscalculation, which could spiral into a
wider conflict. Such a conflict would wipe out Taiwan’s economy, including its semiconductor industry,
on which global supply chains rely. It would also risk drawing in the US, Australia and Japan, starting a
catastrophic global conflict.

Thumm adds that any business interruption loss could
potentially be much higher as electricity prices have
soared: “It is therefore more important than ever to
assess and mitigate operational risks with a professional
underwriting and risk consulting dialogue.”

The energy crisis has made it clear: there is no way around decarbonizing the
economy. This requires not only billions in investments in new technologies,
but also a comprehensive redesign of corporate reporting, helping to ensure
compliance challenges remain a top five risk.

Extending the reporting scope beyond the current focus on
financial risks makes the disclosure of information a much
more complex and challenging exercise, not least as the
CSRD follows a “double materiality” approach: it requires
assessing both impact directions. While the “financial
materiality” is concerned with the impact of environmental,
social, and governance (ESG) issues on the financial
performance of assets (outside-in perspective), the “impact
materiality” concentrates on the environmental and social
impacts that an asset causes (inside-out perspective).
",,1
257,"Asian experts are most likely to be positive
about preparedness, while American experts
were especially downbeat: only 12%
considered public authorities to be ready
to face financial instability risks, 13% for
macro-economic risks, and 19% for monetary
and fiscal policy risks.

Overall, both experts and the general public
from all geographies tend to consider the
private sector more prepared than public
authorities for financial risks. This should
encourage the private sector and insurers
to propose solutions. It also bolsters the case
for the private and public sectors to work hand
in hand on addressing market crises: for each
of these three risks, experts considered
public-private partnerships the best approach.

3 main concerns of general population and experts
with regard to financial stability risks

Experts are concerned
about systemic market failures

Financial instability is the only economic risk to appear
in the top ten ranking of both experts and the general public.
The two groups of respondents are mostly aligned on their main
reason for choosing this risk: systemic failure in financial
markets. ",,0
258,"When asked if people globally are more or less vulnerable to risk
than they were five years ago, 89% of experts said more
vulnerable – up from 84% last year.

Experts and the general public alike tend to believe that people
are more vulnerable in the world at large than in their own
continent, country or city: the closer to home we asked them
to think about, the less likely respondents were to say that
vulnerability is increasing. Only 67% of experts – and 61% of the
general public – agreed that people in their own city or village
were more vulnerable than they were five years ago, in both
cases slightly down on last year. This suggests that familiar
environments and networks of personal bonds alleviate the
feeling of vulnerability.

When we asked whether respondents feel vulnerable to specific
risks in their daily life, they were more likely to say yes in relation
to more tangible risks – such as pollution, terrorism, chronic
illnesses, pandemics and energy – than those which may still feel
more abstract but rank higher overall, such as geopolitical
tensions and climate change.

259,"The Americas and Africa were the only regions where experts put
cyber risks in their top two, while the Americas was the only
region in which the general public ranked it in their top three,
showing concern about cyber-attacks on big US companies and
critical services.

Europeans are focused on energy risks.
Given the potential consequences of the war in Ukraine for
Europe’s energy supply, both experts and the general public
ranked energy risks higher than in any other region – 4th and
3rd respectively.

Social tensions are a worry in America.
Experts in the Americas ranked social tensions and movements
as their 4th-highest risk, while the general public ranked it 5th.
In both cases this was higher than for any other region, reflecting
recent political turmoil.

Asian and African respondents are focused on health risks.
Asia and Africa were the only regions in which the general public
ranked pandemics and infectious diseases as their top risk, and
experts put it in the top two. The public in Africa also ranked
chronic illnesses higher than anywhere else, in 7th position.

This is particularly interesting when considering other

risks making the top 10 list for 2032 in tandem with

succession and talent challenges. Several of the long-term

top risk concerns relate to technology and innovation. This

interaction between talent and technology is reflected by

the second-highest risk for 2032 — perceived challenges

associated with being able to attract the talent and

skills needed to position the organization to adopt and

deploy digital technologies to remain competitive in the

marketplace. That same kind of talent and technology

interaction is also indicated by respondent concerns that

existing legacy IT operations, lack of in-house IT talent,

in the C-suite, may make it difficult for the organization

to compete in a digital marketplace. ",,0

According to Allianz Risk Barometer respondents, a
data breach is the exposure which concerns companies
most (53%), given data privacy and protection is one of
the key cyber risks and related legislation has toughened

significant notification costs, fines and penalties, and
also lead to litigation or demands for compensation from
affected customers, suppliers and data breach victims,
notwithstanding any reputational damage to the impacted
company. The average cost of a data breach reached

265,"Although this expansion has provided new avenues
of financing, the coordination of relief between
international organizations, the “Paris Club” and

other state creditors, as well as the private sector will
continue to complicate attempts at restructuring. For
example, only three countries – Chad, Ethiopia and
Zambia – are currently undergoing treatment under
the G20 Common Framework for Debt Treatments.
All remain unresolved, reflecting challenging
geopolitical and economic dynamics as well as a
lack of transparency.131

The call for wealthier economies to intervene
bilaterally is growing – likely increasing longer-term
geopolitical tensions. China has become a large
bilateral creditor to many low-income countries
and, by some estimates, has become the largest
official creditor globally.132 Energy exporters, such as
the Middle East and the United States of America,
are also well-placed to step into the gap over the
medium-term. Renewed soft power approaches
and debt-trap diplomacy could redraw regional
and global political lines, driving currency blocs
and possibly exacerbating pressures on developing
countries as supply chains shift to mirror economic
alliances.133 This trend could also destabilize security
dynamics, as debt is leveraged to pull developing
economies into the military expansion of larger
powers (see Chapter 2.4: Human security).

The 12th Allianz Risk Barometer incorporates
the views of 2,712 respondents from
94 countries and territories. The annual
corporate risk survey was conducted
among Allianz customers (businesses
around the globe), brokers and industry
trade organizations. It also surveyed risk
consultants, underwriters, senior managers,
claims experts, as well as other risk
management professionals in the corporate
insurance segment of both AGCS and other
Allianz entities.

Respondents were questioned during October
and November 2022. The survey focused
on large- and small- to mid-size companies.
Respondents were asked to select the
industry about which they were particularly

such as phishing attacks, for instance, quantifying
a monthly amount for insurance purposes is often

there may be too many variables to calculate the

Many organisations use a risk management

need to progress through trial and error. “It is
super-complicated,” said one chief audit executive

For provider organizations, funding that was provided to

maintain operations has run short, ending in 2022, and the

financial burden of delivering care into 2023 will further

hinder their financial success.

In most countries around the world, there is no

additional government support in sight. Thus, healthcare

organizations are seeking solutions to decrease operational

costs and improve revenues, as their pre-pandemic

strategies may no longer be sufficient. Lower operating

margins hinder the ability of leadership to further invest in

their strategy for growth, implement process efficiencies

through the use of technology, and align their organization

There is also the continuing risk of political violence in
the United States, even as some who participated in the
Capitol riots two years ago on 6 January are now being
sent to prison. The polarization that drives public anger
has become a structural feature of American life, fueled
in part by social media (please see risk #3).

Of course, red-blue animosity has been trending higher
for decades. But today, roughly two-thirds of Americans
view members of the opposing party not just as wrong but
as dishonest, immoral, and a threat to the country itself.
And the belief that threats and violence are politically
justified has risen among members of both parties—
though the increase has been sharper among Republicans.
American’s growing propensity toward settling political
debates through non-democratic means will increase the
risk of large-scale protests and one-off acts of political
violence.

For all these reasons, America’s bitter political polarization

insurance support public trust and a positive reputation (see Figure 11). This is
a significant shift from 2022, when 33% pointed to the role risk management

This change also comes at a time when reputational risks for tech companies

teams to focus on identifying and quantifying potential reputational challenges
and work to find ways to manage and mitigate these risks.

Cyber Risks The volume and sophistication of malicious cyber activity has increased substantially, and there are growing

concerns regarding the security of proprietary corporate data and critical industrial control systems.

Cloud computing poses elevated risks due to increased concentration and accumulations. Operational

risks exist for corporations and could also lead to large property losses with high and previously unknown

accumulation potential if industrial facilities were simultaneously attacked. The growing request for personal

identification and authentication, the use of biometric identifiers and the multiple uses of identifiers will likely

increase the risk of identity fraud and even theft.

Widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies and Decentralized finance (DeFi), a platform for banking functions

leveraging the blockchain technology, has implications for data protection, anti-money laundering, financial

stability, financial inclusion, cyber threats and climate risks (for instance, bitcoin “mining” still largely requires

Organization type analysis

All four of our organization types indicate higher levels of

likelihood that they will invest more time and resources

in building out their risk management infrastructure in

2023 relative to 2022 (and 2021 for public companies).

Private companies that anticipate going public express the

highest degree of likelihood for increased investment in

2023 (7.02). Not-for-profit and governmental organizations

indicate the highest increase in the likelihood of additional

investment in 2023 (6.99 vs. 6.33 in 2022).

the end of 2022 there were almost two unfilled positions

reported that 40% of workers globally said they might

Fire and explosion ranks #9 overall (14%), falling from #7 in
2022. Risks are often well understood and typically well risk
managed. However, BI and supply chain disruption from fires
remains a significant hazard, especially where companies
rely on third party suppliers for critical components. Claims
analysis by Allianz shows that fire is the largest single cause
of corporate insurance losses, accounting for 21% of the
value of 500,000+ insurance industry claims over the past
five years (equivalent to €18bn).

Such macroeconomic developments rank as the third top
risk for companies in 2023 (25%), up from #10 in 2022.

certain business models uneconomic while it also has a
direct relationship to the cost of BI. ",,0

Increasing litigation activities may come with large losses under environmental liability, product liability

and D&O/professional liability. On the asset side, assets may become obsolete due to policy changes (e.g.

categories: 1) Carbon dioxide removal techniques (CDR) refer to solutions that aim at reducing carbon

emissions (e.g., reforestation, carbon capture and storage (CCS), ocean fertilization or artificial trees); and

2) Solar geoengineering or “solar radiation management” (SRM) refers to technologies proposed to rapidly

categories of organizations: (1) succession challenges and

the ability to attract and retain top talent, (2) increased

labor costs that may hinder growth, and (3) economic

conditions. These three risk concerns are issues affecting

organizations in noticeable ways, regardless of size.

example, the global vertical farming market has been
predicted to grow at a compound annual rate of
26% and hit $34 billion by 2033.10 These agricultural
production techniques increase food output per unit

but can actually be more carbon-intensive and may
have an indirect land footprint that exceeds openfield farming in some regions.11

Given a highly uncertain economic outlook,
developing and emerging markets may struggle
to close the funding gap to increase agricultural
productivity. Pressure on biodiversity will likely be
further amplified by continued deforestation for
agricultural processes, with an associated demand for
additional cleared cropland,12 especially in subtropical

Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia.13 Biodiversity

Biography

Matt Hoyles is an Executive Advisor in Gartner’s Risk Management Practice. He helps

Chief Risk Officers and their leadership teams manage risk in their organization in the

most strategic, efficient, forward-looking way possible, adding value through timely

guidance based on an evolving risk environment.

Specifically, his areas of expertise include risk program and functional management, risk

culture and the full lifecycle of the risk management process.

Matt began his career in education and then into education consultancy. ",,0
307,"These leaders rated four

of the 2032 risks as “Significant Impact,” whereas in the

previous year they did not rank any of the risks at this

level. On the other hand, CEOs expressed the largest

decrease in “Significant Impact” top five risks — this group

rated all of their 2031 top five risks at the highest level but

had one such risk for 2032.

The results prominently reflect the importance of

bringing varying perspectives to the ERM process. Each

executive is needed to best identify and assess risks in

disparate environments and over longer versus shorter

time horizons. It is of paramount importance that both

the board and the management team engage in dialogue

regarding the critical enterprise risks, given the different

perspectives each brings to the table and the potential

for a lack of consensus. Without clarity of focus, the

executive team may not be aligned both internally and

with the board on what the top risks are. Worse, they may

not be appropriately addressing the most important risks

facing the organization, thereby leaving the organization

potentially vulnerable to certain risk events.

by sanctions, left without leverage over the EU or the United
States, with little to lose from further isolation and Western
retaliation, and facing intense domestic pressure to show
strength, Russia will turn to asymmetric warfare against the
West to inflict damage and weaken NATO unity, rather than
employ overt aggression that depends on military and/or
economic power that Russia no longer has.

Rogue Russia will increasingly act like a global version
of its now-closest remaining ally of consequence, Iran.
Before Russia’s fall from grace, Iran had been the world’s

most powerful rogue state, itself effectively “decoupled”
from the international community. Accordingly, Tehran
has long pursued a revisionist foreign policy in the Middle
East via asymmetric means, including espionage, drone
and missile strikes, support for terrorism, proxy wars,
and the like. Russia will likewise intensify its efforts to

with digital disruption requires assembling the right talent,

putting in significant efforts to upskill and reskill existing

employees, and focusing on change management.

Other risk issues are entangled here, as well. For example, in

the event of a recession, companies are likely to cut research

and development budgets, and startups building emerging

technologies will struggle to raise venture capital. Organiza
tions with deeper pockets may invest in struggling startups by

acquiring the business or picking off their talent. Either way,

there would be disruption all around, even for the buyers.

Culture challenges

The scenarios cited above also entail big risks for companies

with deeper pockets. Conflicting corporate cultures is

one of the major reasons many merger and acquisition

transactions fail or do not measure up to expectations. It

is no surprise that TMT executives identify resistance to

change in the organization’s culture as the fifth-ranked

risk issue. The concern here is that such resistance would

restrict organizations from making necessary adjustments

to the business model and core operations on a timely basis.

Many organizations are purchasing

their customers and employees can
convene virtually, whether to work,
shop, or otherwise engage.

2. Launching fully digital products.
Digital assets such as non-fungible
tokens (NFTs) are being sold and
bought as end products in and of
themselves. Sometimes, NFTs can also
serve as passports to unlock physical
world features, such as exclusive
physical collector items or in-person
membership benefits.

3. Creating digital twins of physical
items. Metaverse technologies can
help create digital replicas of existing
physical products and processes,
ranging from apparel to buildings
to supply chains. Digital twins can
help proactively identify and mitigate
potential issues with physical products

tracked how major changes in our
world are taking shape; it helps us
to anticipate future threats in order to

already discussed in previous years

geopolitics, energy, and economic and
social instability.

concerns the climate emergency.
For the first time, climate risk tops
the rankings in all regions of the world,

general public in the United States.
Geopolitical tensions come second

San Francisco, New York and Seattle. This ease with which

employees and senior management are able to move between

jobs appears to be driving some of the people management

challenges that many TMT companies now face.

Going into 2023, it is important for TMT leaders to understand

the multiple factors involved with retaining talent during

a potential recession. They need to consider these key

questions: How do you determine the skills/experience your

organization needs during and after the recession? How well

do you communicate to your employees amid uncertain times,

including during potential downsizing? What type of employee

experience are you creating for the people that you retain?

The chief audit executives that participated
in Risk in Focus 2023 are grappling
with this reality. This year, the report
explores five thematic risks – geopolitical
uncertainty, climate change, organisational
culture, cyber and data risk, and
digitalisation and artificial intelligence.
It outlines those challenges in detail and
offers practical advice and know how
about how to help organisations adjust to
this new reality.

disruption
In particular, Schlegel predicts that stress
on supply chains will be a constant feature
over the next few years, especially since
the European Commission’s Proposal for
a Directive on Corporate Sustainability
Due Diligence seeks to further tighten
environmental and human rights protection
in law5. In this year’s survey, supply chain,
outsourcing and “nth” party risk ranked
eighth in terms of its potential impact (up
from ninth in 2022) and respondents said
it ranked sixth in terms of the areas where
internal audit functions spend most time
and effort.

The nature of extended enterprises means
that organisations are increasingly exposed
to high-impact events directly and through
their supply chains. The answer?
“Get clear visibility of your supply chains then
digitise them,” Schlegel says. ",,1
327,"At the same time, to address the growing
concentration of data in the hands of a small
number of private-sector companies, governments
may increasingly push for open-data policies from
both public- and private-sector sources, mirroring
recent regulatory moves by the EU around data
spaces and marketplaces.111 Such policies – like the
creation of public data trusts for research purposes
– will likely affect both domestic companies and
industries, as well as allied countries. This may
benefit more widespread and diffused innovation,
but it will also expand risks as they enable privacy
breaches at a much larger scale. ",,0

the opposite given the wide range of security threats

and challenges the industry continues to face — from

4 Inflation shockwaves
The global inflation shock that began in the United States in 2021 and took hold worldwide in
2022 will have powerful economic and political ripple effects in 2023. It will be the principal
driver of global recession, add to financial stress, and stoke social discontent and political
instability everywhere.

Today’s historically high inflation comes from multiple sources. First was the Covid-19 pandemic, which prompted governments
to cushion the fall in incomes with extraordinary fiscal and monetary stimulus at the same time that it disrupted global supply.

The energy crisis arrives in the top 10 global risks for the first time at #4, as the
world grapples with spiraling fuel costs, supply disruptions, inflation, and the

332,"Most importantly, voters across
the United States rejected virtually all candidates running for governor or secretary of state
who denied the legitimacy of Biden’s victory over Trump in the 2020 vote. And it’s governors
and secretaries of state who will administer future elections at the state level. That’s why US
politics doesn’t appear higher on this year’s list of top risks.

But it still made the cut.

The United States remains one of the most politically polarized and dysfunctional of the world’s advanced industrial
democracies. The growing partisan polarization of the American electorate is continuing to erode the legitimacy of
core federal institutions: the three branches of government and the peaceful transfer of power through free and fair
elections. Consequently, political power is devolving to the states, increasingly led by partisans stepping into the void
left by Washington to pursue agendas that cannot be implemented by a fractious and sclerotic federal government.
Accordingly, the contrast in policy direction between Texas and California, for example, is far starker than it was even
five years ago.

While the energy crisis could have a positive
long-term impact on the decarbonization of
the economy, the associated increase in energy
poverty could also undermine the acceptance of
climate policy – unless effective and lasting aid
measures can be established.

“A new social contract is needed to address
the long-term challenges of the higher energy
prices likely during the green transformation,”
says Subran. There are two channels of impact:
via the generation of income (labor) and use
(consumption). Overall, the employment effects
of the green transformation are likely to be
small, at least in net terms. In fact, there is likely
to be a massive shift in jobs across sectors and
regions. “Green” jobs will require different and

loss of social capital and fracturing of communities
leading to declining social stability, individual and
collective wellbeing and economic productivity, it
ranked as the fifth-most severe global risk faced in
the short term by GRPS respondents. It was also
seen as one of the most strongly influenced risks
in the global network, triggered by many other
short- and longer-term potential risks – including
debt crises and state instability, cost-of-living crises
and inflation, a prolonged economic downturn and
climate migration (Figure 1.9).

Arab Emirates would be vulnerable as well but less so,

Lastly, there will be more questions this year about the
stability and longevity of the Islamic Republic. The chance
of regime collapse is low, but it’s higher than at any point
in the past four decades. For most Iranians, the state has
lost legitimacy and shows little capacity to reform. The
uncertainty rises if Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, 83, dies
or is incapacitated. The leader has no chosen successor,
and the succession process has only happened once in the
state’s history. These problems could create unexpected
infighting during the transition and open the door for the
Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps to further expand its
influence—shifting Iran closer to a military dictatorship
with a more aggressive policy toward the region.

Instability

Post the financial crisis, lower income groups are still to see a return to income growth with stagnant standards of living persisting for many.

This rising inequality compounds instability in economic systems, and politically these factors fuel the rise in populism and a reaction against

multinational institutions, leading to nationalism and fragmented regulation. Long-term low yields and the stimulus tool of massive quantitative

easing may also stoke inflation risks and create asset bubbles.

346,"The biggest increase in overall

risk impressions for 2023 is reported by the Consumer

Products and Services industry group, which went

from just two “Significant Impact” risks for 2022 to 12

for 2023. The Healthcare and Technology, Media and

Telecommunications industry groups also show large

increases in “Significant Impact” risks in 2023. Healthcare

jumped from four to 12 and Technology, Media and

Telecommunications from zero to seven.

On the other hand, Financial Services respondents

have decreased the number of risks that are considered

“Significant Impact” from two in 2022 to none for 2023.

The overall differences in perceptions about the risk

environment and about specific risks suggest there is

an elevation in concerns among the Consumer Products

Telecommunications industry groups, and for the other

industry groups there appears to be a general easing of

delayed due to environmental approvals; projects
in Canada and Australia have slowed based on
concerns relating to indigenous communities; and
a rare species of buckwheat has limited domestic
mining in key locations in the United States of

348,"As the conflict between Russia and Ukraine
approaches one year, economies and societies
will not easily rebound from continued shocks. In
this year’s Global Risks Perception Survey, more
than four in five respondents anticipated consistent
volatility over the next two years. The persistence
of these crises is already reshaping the world that
we live in, ushering in economic and technological
fragmentation. A continued push for national resilience
in strategic sectors will come at a cost – one that only
a few economies can bear. Geopolitical dynamics
are also creating significant headwinds for global
cooperation, which often acts as a guardrail to these
global risks.

The 18th edition of the Global Risks Report considers
this backdrop of simmering geopolitical tensions
and confluence of socioeconomic risks. It identifies
the most severe perceived risks to economies
and societies over the next two years. The world's
collective focus is being channeled into the “survival”
of today’s crises: cost of living, social and political
polarization, food and energy supplies, tepid growth,
and geopolitical confrontation, among others.

The invasion of Ukraine by Russia in February 2022
intensified a febrile risk landscape as economies around
the world contended with the post-Covid recovery,
inflation, and the rising cost of living.

Unrest and protests in the last year ignited over the rights
of women and minorities in Iran, fuel prices in Kazakhstan,
economic failures in Sri Lanka, abortion rights in the US,
corruption in Argentina, and Covid restrictions in China.
The end of the year saw multiple strikes across Europe over

Mental Health Mental health is not just the absence of mental illnesses, but rather a complete mental ability and state of

wellness. Accordingly, it is fundamental to be mentally healthy to be able to perform everyday activities.

Yet, 20% of the world’s population suffer from a mental illness at some point in their lives. Many mental

health issues are not severe and lasting but mild to moderate short-lived mental health conditions such as

depression, anxiety, stress, and burnout. Though most mental illnesses are treatable, it is estimated that

two-thirds of those who suffer from mental health issues go unsupported. Furthermore, mental health risks

are increasing worldwide. Mental stress and isolation caused by the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak will most

likely exacerbate this trend. Consequently, an increase in claims related to mental health such as medical

expenses for Health insurance, occupational Disability claims, Life insurance claims (because of higher

suicide rates), and P&C claims (e.g. Worker’s Compensation, Employers’ Liability, Accident and Health, etc.)",,0

Latin America faces a number of endemic health issues, including

In Mexico, the region’s second largest economy, 70% of the
population is overweight. This translates into a high incidence
of high blood pressure, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes
and other chronic diseases. The public healthcare system is
overburdened, and a mere 8% of Mexico’s 130 million inhabitants
buy private health insurance.
In 2019, we launched AXA Keralty, offering an integrated health

programs, diagnostics (such as blood analysis and X-rays), general,
pediatric and gynecological primary care, and ten specialties
including orthopedic, urology and psychology services. At the core

Established key risk areas that should have been identified and understood
by the IAF, versus emerging risk areas that are developing, but whose full

enterprises would find appealing. Industry research indicates that network security

Conclusion
Major global developments in labor markets, technology, geopolitics and

macroeconomics have led to significant changes in the key risks CAEs must plan for since

we published our 2023 Audit Plan Hot Spots report.

Retention and recruitment efforts are complicated as labor markets remain competitive

overall and dynamics surrounding salary discussions are shifting. Regulations on pay

transparency and the potential for a wide-ranging ban on noncompetes could empower

employees to win higher salaries and accelerate job changes.

IT governance is rapidly shifting in the face of new technologies and compliance

are doing business; how locations and ecosystems are impacted;
how much these companies are contributing in terms of taxes,
employment, and commerce; and whether they’re paying a “fair
share.” These concerns are reflected in regulations and reporting
requirements taking shape today:

• Tax transparency is a major component of the most recently
released Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 207 standard, which
went into effect January 1, 2021. Issued by the Global Sustainability
Standards Board, the initiative requires that companies disclose
country-by-country tax information, plus information about their
tax strategy, accountability, governance, stakeholders, security
practices, customer privacy, marketing and labeling, indirect
impacts, and more.53 While this new standard is not mandatory, GRI
standards are widely adopted voluntarily, as many companies and
industries look to apply leading practices in sustainability reporting.
As a result of GRI 207, companies are considering the role tax plays
in their sustainability narrative and reporting more actively.

further existential threat to digitalized networks. Non-economic disruptors like the COVID-19 pandemic,

international sanctions, or the increased public scrutiny for adherence to ESG standards are gradually

re-shaping supply chains globally. Near-shoring and regionalization, the build-up of strategic storage, and

diligent sourcing of scarce resources are emerging trends that are leading to higher inflation but also,

progressively, to more resilient supply chains.

• ESG reporting is quickly moving from a voluntary to mandatory activity, as

regulators around the globe take a broader interest in corporate responsibility.

• In March 2022, the U.S. SEC proposed a new rule requiring companies to disclose

climate-related metrics and greenhouse gas emissions in their financial filings.

• In Europe, expanded requirements are positioning the EU and the U.K. as global

leaders in ESG and climate reporting.

• Number of investor inquiries about ESG

• Percentage of ESG metrics verified

• Change in number of ESG reporting requirements

• Percentage of completion of ESG goals

• Existence of policies and procedures for managing key sustainability risks (e.g.,

Introduction

The risk drivers for workforce management, IT governance and organizational resilience

have evolved since we published our 2023 Audit Plan Hot Spots report in September 2022

(see Table 1).

Forty-eight percent of HR leaders said their organizations had slowed hiring, and

33% had frozen it for at least some roles, in response to prevailing economic activity.

This is despite a 53-year low in the U.S. unemployment rate.

■

New developments in generative AI technology, especially open access to tools such

as ChatGPT, are giving rise to new risks from three major vectors: outside the

organization, ungoverned employee use and unintended consequences of enterprise

use.

■

Spiking geopolitical tensions between China and the U.S. are impacting businesses

through export controls, financial limits and sanctions, with possible further barriers

to trade and economic activity.

■

Assess talent strategies by reviewing current hiring plans and evaluating the

organization’s approach to assessing risks associated with overhiring, underhiring

and layoffs.

376,"Indeed, private sector initiatives addressing climate change through innovative tech may prove the most effective
avenue to actuating change at a time when international, multi-lateral dialogue has stalled.

To potentially benefit from these advancements, managers and executives should embrace change and welcome
tech innovation across all business functions, understanding that value added by digital transformation goes
beyond traditional cost benefit analysis and includes what the risks of inaction may bring in the market. Corporate
decision-makers should understand the process for how AI is developed and deployed. What are the most critical
AI systems and processes the company has deployed? To what extent is bias—conscious or unconscious—built
into the strategy, development, algorithms, deployment, and outcomes of AI-enabled processes?

expectations

Customer centricity starts from within. After all, customer
interactions often require contributions from several departments.
A lack of alignment between functions and systems can hinder the
ability to deliver smooth customer experiences.

Use cloud as a tool to reach ESG ambitions
As ESG climbs the corporate agenda, we can expect it to play a
more influential role in digital strategy. A future next step for
businesses that have already embraced cloud as a foundation is to
use the technology to improve visibility into ESG metrics and
goals. According to the 2022 KPMG Digital to the Core survey
report, almost 27 percent of respondents say that advancing their
ESG commitments/priorities is a key driver of their digital
transformation investments. Look to cloud technologies to help
quantify and track progress around ESG responsibilities such as
reducing carbon footprint and improving sustainability. More than
one in five respondents already consider ESG-related
improvements a top three benefit of cloud in their enterprise.

to the coronavirus—experts are warning that other infectious diseases will soon emerge (such as
monkeypox). If another aggressive variant of the coronavirus materialises, developed countries may
impose lockdowns. Consumer and investor sentiment would sink, leading to a downturn in financial
markets, services and retail sales. Travel bans would return, dampening the tourism recovery. The
vaccination drive would reset if vaccine producers have to start from scratch, and the global economy
would go back into recession.

Scenario six: inter-state cyberwar cripples state infrastructure in major
economies

Moderate probability; Very high impact
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and tensions surrounding Taiwan have increased the likelihood of major
state-on-state cyber-attacks. Given the much higher costs of direct military conflict and the difficulty in
identifying perpetrators of cyber-attacks, any military escalation is most likely initially to take the form
of cyber-warfare. This could be triggered by a complete diplomatic breakdown, leading to an escalating

capital out of emerging markets and into the US.

• A possible financial crisis that will be mismanaged
because of lack of global policy coordination.

• Debt defaults in several countries, which would
further weaken global growth, fueling already

WITH ADOPTION OF NEXT-GEN TECHNOLOGIES,
SECURITY BREACHES EMERGE AS A SIGNIFICANT RISK

Occurrences of cyberattacks, including computer
viruses, hacking, ransomware attacks, malicious
social engineering, etc., against companies have
increased in recent years. They have also
become more sophisticated, making it more
difficult to protect networks and systems.
Telecom companies may suffer equipment
failures, loss of sensitive information, and
disruptions of their own and customers’
operations as a result of cyberattacks. ",1.0,0
384,"Many smaller companies
continue to be under the misconception that
cyber-attacks won’t happen to them but as
many large businesses ramp up their cyber
security investments the opposite is true.

More and more poorly protected smaller
companies are being exploited as a
consequence of this and they can be particularly
susceptible to supply chain attacks. The reality
is that if a small company suffers a significant
cyber incident, and it hasn’t adequately
managed this risk, there is a chance it may
not survive in the long run. Companies need
to better understand their exposures, invest in
cyber security, raise employee awareness and
develop response plans.

some supply chain challenges are slowly becoming less

intensive, critical short- and long-term challenges for

manufacturing and distribution organizations remain, from

access to critical raw materials to often fragile logistics.

These issues directly impact customers of manufacturing and

distribution organizations and, as a result, the bottom line.

At the same time, whereas two years ago the focus was

on pandemic-related supply chain issues, today the focus

is more on effects on the supply chain resulting from

geopolitical issues, including but not limited to Russia’s war

on Ukraine and China-U.S. relations. These developments

and the uncertainty they create are contributing to the

staying power of supply chain risk as the top concern for

this industry group. Moreover, as we discuss in more detail

below, uncertainties surrounding the organization’s core

389,"Three major shocks may have a significant
impact on corporates’ profitability:

The energy crisis will remain the largest profitability
shock, in particular for European countries. At current
levels, energy prices would wipe out the profits of most
non-financial corporates as pricing power is diminishing
amid slowing demand. If firms can pass one quarter
of energy-price increases on to customers, they can
withstand a price increase of below +50% and +40% in
Germany and France, respectively.

Additionally, the interest rate shock is looming in the first
half of 2023, along with the acceleration in wages in the
wake of unprecedented inflation. In Europe, this is likely to
be equivalent to the Covid-19 profitability shock of -4pp.
As expected, high cash balances for corporates (still 43%
above pre-Covid-19 levels in the US, +36% in the UK and
+32% in the Euro-zone) have provided a significant buffer
against the monetary policy normalization in 2022, but
the worst is still to come. Overall, the rise in financing and
wage costs in a context of low economic growth puts the
construction, transportation, telecoms, machinery and
equipment, retail, household equipment, electronics,
automotive and textiles sectors particularly at risk.

Reliability and security remain
top worries, but reputational risk
emerging as a major concern
Maintaining reliable and secure networks remains the biggest challenge for technology companies (see Figure 2). The
top three risks in this year’s report — data security and privacy, digital business interruption, and technology errors and
omissions — have consistently ranked as top risks for all nine years of this report. IT resilience, which is closely linked to the
top three risks, remained in the top 5, the same as last year.

But survey respondents have expressed a deepening worry about reputational risk. Ranked tenth in 2022, nearly half of
respondents this year cited reputational risk as a major concern, pushing it up to the fourth spot. This could be a result of the
growth of technology companies, many of which have become household names, which results in business practices or any
mishaps being heavily publicized and scrutinized.

Although more than 1.1 billion people have

growth in terms of improving quality of life
have been unevenly distributed. Wealth has
accrued disproportionately to the top 10%
of the world’s population. The gap between
the richest and poorest is wider than at any
time since 1985. “Inclusive growth” – which
refers to more equal distribution of economic
growth across income levels, genders and
regions, among other factors – supports
resilience by lifting individuals out of poverty
and increasing opportunities for all.

mentioned most by the participants, offering insights

on trends and patterns in the responses received.

Interestingly, most of the statements noted in the cloud

were asked to rate in our study. Given that the exercise

gave the participants the opportunity to express in their

own words what was top of mind for them as they looked

out 10 years, the results validate the completeness of the

38 risks they rated in our survey. Interestingly, “changes” is

the most common word followed by predominant words —

technology, organization, security, government, regulatory,

market, cyber, political, emerging, customer, war, energy,

environment, global, costs, people, employees, inflation,

instability and climate — that add context to the kind of

changes on the minds of directors and executives as they

consider risks 10 years out. Again, these themes also relate

to a number of risks ranked highly in our overall survey

results, as we have discussed in this report.

One interesting point is that “climate” was not as

predominant as in our prior two surveys when we began

offering this open-ended question. ",,0
397,"Furthermore, the

respondents are concerned about having the data analytics

and “big data” capabilities to gain insights about customer

experiences and markets to inform decision-making as well

as take advantage of operational efficiency opportunities.

Clearly, talent and technology concerns are intertwined

over the long term.

Executives and boards are clearly focused

on whether their organizations will be

able to attract the talent they need to

remain competitive, with that concern

affecting them now and perceived to be a

challenge a decade from now.

Respondents are also focused on potential shifts in

regulatory priorities and how changes in regulations might

impact the way their organizations’ processes are designed

and how their products are produced and delivered.

As executives and boards look a decade out, they are

focused on the potential for new regulations to emerge as

expectations around what is deemed acceptable continue

to shift. Perhaps, as respondents reflect on rapidly shifting

expectations over the last decade — or even recent years

— related to social, privacy and environmental issues,

among other changes, they are projecting ahead a similar

noticeable shift as they keep a wary eye on potential

scenarios and developments over the next decade.

In the coming years, the International Sustainability
Standards Board (ISSB), based in Germany, will decide to
what extent the European standards will also gain global
acceptance. For the time being, there can be no talk of a
level playing field.

In other areas, sustainability and the green transformation
are likely to lead to more fragmentation for the time being.
The EU has set the course for the Carbon Border Adjustment
Mechanism (CBAM). Even if the logic of a CBAM can hardly
be criticized – without an appropriate mechanism, there
is a risk of carbon leakage and a permanent impairment
of European competitiveness – it represents an additional
burden on international trade flows. And this at a time when
geopolitical upheavals are casting their long shadows on
the progress of globalization.

of the most dynamic, fast-moving risk areas for
the profession.

As temperatures soared to unusually high
levels across Europe at the time of writing, the

evidence of unpredictable change is clear
– yet unless internal auditors get a firm grip on
the issue now, the risk could become the next
big crisis that organisations are unprepared
for. While internal auditors are shifting more
resources into climate change assignments,
they do not yet give it the priority it deserves.
Today, it ranks only 11th place in terms of where
they say they spend their time and effort.
If internal auditors want to move it to 4th place,

differences in risk concerns across multiple industries may

help tease out risks that otherwise could be overlooked.

• Respondents in the Consumer Products and Services

industry group and Healthcare industry group rate 12

of 38 risks at the “Significant Impact” level, suggesting

that respondents in these industry groups are the most

concerned about how they are managing their risks.

In contrast, respondents in the Technology, Media and

Telecommunications industry group rate seven risks at

that level, whereas respondents in the Manufacturing

and Distribution industry group only rate three of the

38 risks at the “Significant Impact” level. Finally (and

surprisingly), respondents in Financial Services and

However, while regulation and policy are often viewed as external risks, they
can also open up opportunities: witness the support for infrastructure upgrades
from the EU Recovery Fund and US Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. More
generally, government funding and incubation of digital ecosystems can help
foster telcos’ ability to monetize demand from enterprise customers. With these
different forces in play, telcos that can build more substantive relationships with

introduced worldwide are modeled on the EU’s general data protection regulation

the central banks’ balancing act between tightening
monetary policy to keep inflation at bay, while avoiding
a permanent depression of global demand and
investment growth. This may be very tricky, especially
if the supply side causes of inflation persist – i.e.,
supply chain disruptions, demographic challenges,
impact of the war in Ukraine on critical commodities.
As such, business leaders may face two types of profit
margin erosion:

01
High input and operational costs such as
energy, raw material, and labor. Stubborn
inflation can act as a tax on everything
business does, including future investment.
Companies with sophisticated supply chains
might have to spend more on beefing up
inventory just to avoid supply shortages and

nature of a particular industry; c) the
effectiveness of fiscal policy intervention;

All of this implies that the risks of a slower and more
disorderly transition (extensively covered in last year's ) have now turned into reality,
potentially leading to dire planetary and societal
consequences. Any rollback of government and
private action will continue to amplify risks to human
health (explored in Chapter 2.3: Human health) and
spur the deterioration of natural capital, as discussed
in Chapter 2.2: Natural ecosystems. Climate
change will also increasingly become a key migration
driver and there are indications that it has already

conflicts in Asia, the Middle East and Africa.36

In the 2030 time frame, two critical factors will
determine the trajectory of our ability to match
supply and demand for these resources as well
as the scale of the associated polycrisis: 1) the
degree of global cooperation that allows the flow of
resources across national borders, and 2) the impact
of climate change on the supply of natural resources
and speed of the low-carbon transition (Box 3.1).

– including political conflicts, weather events, lockdowns
and ESG considerations – are driving some companies
to regionalize their supply chains, from sourcing
to consumer market distribution, in an effort to reduce
lead times and mitigate growing risks. While this private
sector strategy is only beginning to manifest, the result
will be increasing commercial regionalization: according
to McKinsey & Company, as much as a quarter of global
goods exports – or $4.5 trillion – could shift by 2025.
In the context of deepening geopolitical competition
and macro-economic instability, these deglobalizing
and regionalizing trends are likely to endure.

Following another year of global supply chain disruption, business interruption
ranks as the second most concerning risk. A consequence of many of the other
top risks in the Allianz Risk Barometer it is of perennial concern for companies
the world over.

Indeed a number of BI-related risks have climbed this
year’s rankings, reflecting the economic and political
consequences of the pandemic and war in Ukraine. The
energy crisis is a new entrant to the 2023 survey, while
concerns for macroeconomic developments, political risks,
shortages of labor and critical infrastructure failure all

China's COVID-19 policies could drive up energy

resilience of global supply chains if policy changes
remain unpredictable as infections soar.

Cost-of-living crisis was broadly perceived by
GRPS respondents to be a short-term risk, at peak
severity within the next two years and easing off
thereafter. But the persistence of a global cost-ofliving crisis could result in a growing proportion of
the most vulnerable parts of society being priced out
of access to basic needs, fueling unrest and political
instability. Continued supply-chain disruptions
could lead to sticky core inflation, particularly in
food and energy. This could fuel further interest rate
hikes, raising the risk of debt distress, a prolonged

Increasing bilateral or multilateral disputes between countries may result in trade wars and military conflicts,

as demonstrated by the Ukraine war. This risk is compounded by nuclear proliferation and new military

technology such as autonomous weapons. Geopolitical conflict threatens the stability of the world economy

and particularly financial markets, which can also lead to a defragmentation of global markets and financial

weaponization. Other potential areas of geopolitical tension include the Korean Peninsula, the South China

government efforts to cushion the impact of extreme
wholesale price spikes. The EU’s industrial sector will
remain at risk of government-mandated curbs on gas
supply, threatening energy-intensive sectors such as steel,
aluminum, and fertilizers, and creating an overall drag
on economic growth. While extended gas shortages in

Europe will be avoided thanks to reduced consumption
and close cooperation with allied suppliers such as the
United States and Norway, the risk of temporary power
outages will remain high.

High gas prices as Europe seeks to secure adequate
supplies for the 2023-2024 winter will leave energy-hungry
states in South and Southeast Asia priced out of the LNG
market for long stretches of 2023. The impact will be
felt most acutely in the agricultural sectors of emerging

In 2021, telecom companies focused on the
implementation of strategic and transformative
initiatives. New opportunities linked to individuals
and businesses’ rising demand for connectivity
gave rise to both opportunities and challenges.
Major trends related to ongoing technological
developments and evolving customer preferences
also continued to shape the telecom market.

Telecom companies have strengthened their
internal processes, reconsidered investment
plans, and enhanced service offerings to remain
competitive under challenging market conditions.
As the industry’s business environment becomes
ever more complex and fast-moving, developing
risk management frameworks remains an integral
part of operations.

The report explores the risk landscape facing
telecom companies. It is split into two main
categories: macroeconomic risks and industryspecific risks.1 This approach enables a deep
analysis of specific risk factors.

In this edition, risks relating to interest rates,
foreign exchange, credit, increasing market
competition, and changes in the regulatory
framework remained among the most significant
identified by telecoms.

CYBER AND HEALTH RISKS

INSURERS AND INSTABILITY –
A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE

For the first time, climate change topped the risk rankings
for experts in every geography. Also for the first time, it was
the top concern in the US for the general population. The ranking
suggests that the obvious global impacts of climate change on
biodiversity, health and the economy can no longer be ignored.
Both sets of respondents express declining trust in public
authorities to face the climate crisis: just 14% of experts and 27%
of the public say the authorities are prepared for this risk, down
from 19% and 33% in last year’s study.

Just as the climate crisis focuses attention on the urgency
of the net zero agenda, the energy transition and climate action
have been complicated by geopolitics. In the wake of Russia’s
invasion of Ukraine, the large majority of our experts expect
geopolitical tensions to persist and spread, threatening
the security of energy and food supplies, increasing the risk
of a global war and cyberattacks, and making it more difficult
for governments to cooperate in areas of mutual interest.

The threat of a sovereign debt crisis has been
brewing, with public debt growing as interest rates
have fallen. Governments have leveraged cheap
money to invest in future growth and help stabilize
distressed financial systems, providing massive
fiscal support during the pandemic and to shield
households and businesses from the current costof-living crisis. However, high levels of debt may not
be sustainable under tighter economic conditions.
The rapid and widespread normalization of monetary
policies, accompanied by a stronger US dollar and
weaker risk sentiment, has already increased debt
vulnerabilities that are likely to remain heightened for
years.

Stagflation on a global scale, combined with
historically high levels of public debt, could have
vast consequences.118 Even with a softer landing,
the consequences of debt-trap diplomacy and
rockier restructuring raise the risk of debt distress –
and even default – spreading to more systemically
important markets, paralysing the global economic
system. ",,0
466,"76 percent of CEOs interviewed said they have planned for a recession, and
20 percent are boosting measures to adapt to geopolitical issues as a key strategy in the next 3
years. In short, despite challenging times ahead, 71 percent of CEOs have a renewed sense of
global economic confidence over the next 3 years. In order to capitalize on this optimism, four
interlinked issues should dominate conversations at the board level: stagflation, energy and
food crisis, cost of living crisis and inequality, and the future of ESG. All will be impacted by
geopolitics, particularly by “China’s economic rebound post-zero covid and Europe’s painful
transition to living without Russian energy” (Top Risks #4 Inflation Shockwaves). Monitoring
and managing these macro-trends will likely be key to building business resilience in 2023 and
beyond.

470,"This year will be a tipping point for disruptive technology’s role in society. A new form of AI, known as generative AI, will
allow users to create realistic images, videos, and text with just a few sentences of guidance. Large language models like GPT3 and the soon-to-be-released GPT-4 will be able to reliably pass the Turing test—a Rubicon for machines’ ability to imitate
human intelligence. And advances in deepfakes, facial recognition, and voice synthesis software will render control over one’s
likeness a relic of the past. User-friendly applications such as ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion will allow anyone minimally techsavvy to harness the power of AI (indeed, the title of this risk was generated by the former in under five seconds).

These advances represent a step-change in AI’s potential to manipulate people and sow political chaos. When barriers
to entry for creating content no longer exist, the volume of content rises exponentially, making it impossible for most
citizens to reliably distinguish fact from fiction. Disinformation will flourish, and trust—the already-tenuous basis of
social cohesion, commerce, and democracy—will erode further. ",1.0,0

Xi Jinping now has a command of China’s political system unrivaled since Mao with (very) few limits on his ability to advance his statist and nationalist policy agenda. But with no dissenting voices to challenge his views, his ability to make big long-term mistakes is also unrivaled. That’s a massive global challenge given China’s outsized role in the world economy.
We see risks in three areas this year, all stemming from Maximum Xi. The ill-effects of centralized decision-making on public health will continue with COVID’s spread. Xi’s drive for state control of China’s economy will produce arbitrary decisions, policy volatility, and heightened uncertainty for a country already weakened by two years of extreme Covid controls. Finally, Xi’s nationalist views and assertive foreign policy will increasingly provoke resistance from the West and from China’s Asian neighbors.

Even as inflation shows signs of slowing, prices remain high overall. Organizations face

increased costs, and retail goods and services are also more expensive for consumers.

Recent events have exposed a divergence between

what is scientifically necessary and what is politically

a turning point, encouraging energy-importing
countries to invest in “secure”, cleaner and cheaper
renewable energy sources.32 Yet geopolitical tensions
and economic pressures have already limited – and
in some cases reversed – progress on climate

example, the EU spent at least EUR50 billion on new

rapidly accelerate in the next two years. Negotiations
at the Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC

Mapping out the industry’s risks
It’s against this shifting global and regional background that we’ve conducted our
analysis of the telecoms risk universe for telcos in 2023. As in previous years, we’ve
combined insights from our industry, consumer and enterprise surveys with the
evolving perspectives of our sector practitioners to pinpoint the most critical risks
facing telcos today. As the “risk radar” shows, we organize the sector’s risk factors
into four domains — compliance, operational, strategic and financial — and rank each
risk on its importance and impact.

493,"On the other hand,

respondents to last year’s survey noted growing concerns

about the interest rate environment and ability to compete

for talent in a highly competitive and unusual labor market.

This year’s survey results largely cemented those concerns

as inflation continued to accelerate and central banks

aggressively raised interest rates and unwound monetary

stimulus programs in response. As a result, the likelihood

of a global economic recession increased. At the same

time, and somewhat unusually given softening economic

conditions, most financial institutions are still understaffed

and struggling to attract and retain talent.

Accordingly, the overall 2023 top risks were generally

consistent with those noted last year. Concerns about the

interest rate environment ranked as the top risk in both

2023 and 2022. Four of the top five risks from last year

remained in the top five this year, although a few traded

places. Surprisingly, the risk tied to inflation and economic

conditions more broadly dropped from second to third, and

the average score for this risk fell slightly as well.

third-party external AI systems such as ChatGPT, as well as guide audit’s scrutiny of

internal AI systems the organization uses.

Use by Malicious Actors

Finally, ChatGPT also opens the door to new kinds of risks from malicious actors. The

significant improvement of output quality from bots such as ChatGPT enhances the risk

that cyberattackers use the bot to generate text for phishing emails. Rapid text generation

and improved language quality mean the volume and effectiveness of phishing attempts

could both increase, and the ability to generate much more text could make targeted spear

phishing efforts easier to pull off. One research team found GPT-3-generated phishing

emails were more likely to generate clicks than those written by humans. 28 In addition, the

coding capabilities of ChatGPT are already being used to generate malware, potentially

expanding the volume and variety of threats to organizations. 29

A different kind of malicious activity involves deliberate attempts to corrupt outputs — for

example, through data poisoning to train the bot on biased or offensive inputs or through

jailbreaking techniques to get around the boundaries set on what the bot will generate. ",,0

The general public is more likely than experts to think that future
risks are either “very” or “somewhat” easy to predict.
This discrepancy may help to explain the rising sense of popular
frustration towards public institutions and the private sector for
failing to protect them against risks they may feel it should have
been possible to foresee.

In this climate of growing vulnerability, mistrust and scepticism,
insurers can and should play a major role in enabling people to
pursue their objectives. Nearly 70% of the general public agreed
that insurers will play an important role in mitigating future risks.

Respondent position analysis

Interestingly, most positions indicate an increase in the likelihood of committing enhanced resources to risk management capabilities in 2023,

with the exceptions being board members (who indicate the same likelihood as expressed in last year's survey for 2022) and CIOs/CTOs. Our

new group added this year, CHROs, exhibits the highest level of likelihood of increased investment in the coming year. This is no doubt driven

by the fact that succession challenges and talent acquisition and retention is identified as the top risk concern for 2023.

• Culture remains a priority and it has increased in

significance relative to other risks. In addition to

resistance to change (as discussed above), concerns that

the organization’s culture may not sufficiently encourage

the timely identification and escalation of significant

market opportunities and emerging risk issues is the

eighth-rated risk for the next 12 months and the 16th
rated risk for the next 10 years, whereas last year it was

rated 11th and 23rd, respectively, for the same periods.

This risk merits attention as it is vital that leaders remain

in touch with business realities on the front lines.

• Workplace evolution is more of a near-term issue.

Concerns over whether the organization can manage

the ongoing demands on or expectations of a significant

portion of the workforce either to work remotely or

be a part of a transformed, collaborative hybrid work

environment is the ninth-rated risk for 2023, whereas

it is the 24th-rated risk for 2032. Leaders are having to

deal with this issue in a flexible manner over the near

term as the workplace continues to evolve. Longer-term,

however, this is expected to be less of a concern.

Telcos’ approaches to new ways of working also impact their access to talent.
Looking across industries, employees’ perceptions of their employers have been
positive during the pandemic: 78% believe the organization they work for responded
well. However, TMT employees are significantly more likely than their counterparts
in other sectors to think their employer’s post-COVID-19 workforce strategy will
affect its ability to retain talent in the future. In addition worker churn is ultimately a
greater threat in TMT: 53% of TMT employees say they plan to leave in the next
12 months, against an average of 43% across all sectors.

The views of employers and employees on workforce
culture and the future of work are diverging —
indicating a need for action to sustain a positive
culture and retain vital skills.

The fact that employers are experiencing significant staff turnover is making
them more pessimistic about how the pandemic has impacted company culture.

national budgets will continue to bear the brunt of the

Highlights of key differences

In addition to presenting risk insights from the 1,304

respondents, later sections of this report provide

insights from the analysis of findings across different

dimensions, including size of organization, the positions

of respondents in the organization, industry, geographic

regions, and organization type (public, private, not-for
profit or government).

Differences across sizes of
organizations

• When asked to assess the overall magnitude and severity

of the risk environment for 2023, respondents from

all sizes of organizations rate their overall concern at

the “Significant Impact” level. Executives and boards

from all sizes of organizations perceive the overall risk

environment for 2023 to be higher than 2022 and those

from all sizes of organizations, except the largest (those

with revenues exceeding $10 billion), rate their overall

risk concern for 2023 higher than two years earlier.

When looking at the individual risks included in the

top five list of risks for each of the four size categories

of organizations, all but one of the top risks are rated

higher for 2023 relative to 2022. ",,0

Significance of risks relative to prior years
Before asking respondents to assess the importance of each

of the 38 risks, we asked them to indicate their perceptions

about the overall risk environment using a 10-point scale

where 1 = “Extremely Low” and 10 = “Extremely High.”

As shown in Figure 1, the collective response indicates

an increase in the overall nature of the risk environment,

with an average score of 6.70 in 2023 relative to 6.21 in

2022 and 6.38 in 2021. This overarching response suggests

that board members and executives perceive the risk

environment for 2023 as riskier than they did when looking

forward to 2022 and two years ago in anticipation of 2021.

Most notably, this is the highest level of response to this

question in the 11 years we have asked respondents

to provide their perceptions about the overall risk

environment. ",,0

are also working with traditional network vendors on collaborative solutions for
enterprises, such as private 5G networks. Taken together, these changes mean
telcos must adapt to working with a wider range of suppliers in more varied ways.

However, despite this need for collaboration, ecosystem engagement is still not

of continued weather shocks has been partially
offset through adaptation actions, financed by fit-forpurpose financial products, including weather-based

Supply shocks stemming from natural disasters are
quickly absorbed by flexible, market-driven supply
chains, and global food insecurity continues to slowly
trend downwards.

Risks remain: some natural resources are scarce,
even in a climate-adapted, geopolitically cooperative
world. Demand for geographically concentrated
critical metals and minerals has risen dramatically,
reflecting a push for secure, renewable energy
sources in the wake of the war in Ukraine, and
renewed urgency of net-zero ambitions over recent
years. Despite sufficient resource deposits in most
minerals,9 this exponential increase in demand has
proved difficult to meet through a rapid expansion
of supply. Shortages initially stemmed from limited
exploration and significant capital requirements,
but the rise in commodity prices have subsequently
helped to scale production, with companies now
targeting deposits previously deemed unextractable
for economic or technological reasons.

However, shortages in key materials remain a near-
and mid-term concern, given time lags to production.

Retirees will also be impacted as pensions fail to

Ageing and
Health Concerns

Although Covid has resulted in a spike in mortality, wider medical advances in diagnostics and treatments continue, with developed countries

seeing populations increasingly exposed to age related risks such as neurodegenerative diseases and chronic conditions associated with aging.

There are, however, a number of factors that may off set the improvements in life span achieved through medical advances. In particular,

lifestyle patterns (including sedentary habits, unhealthy diets, sleep disorders, and substance abuse), are contributing to the rise in chronic

diseases in younger populations. Physical health is also closely linked to mental health. Small particles and hazardous chemicals, such as

endocrine disruptors and microplastic, may also pose risks that are not yet fully revealed for instance, and climate related factors such as the

increasingly prevalence of heatwaves poses a threat to elderly populations. It remains unclear whether medical advances will counter-balance

the impacts on morbidity and mortality of these developments.

534,"Globalization is changing, national security
is shaping it

From a corporate perspective, the world has seemed
flat for a considerable time. It may be tempting to
assume a continuation of this trajectory, but we should
remember the history of the last 30 years. The fall of
the Soviet Union allowed for the integration of the
Russian industrial machine into the global system of
trade, providing cheap energy and commodities. A
decade later, China entered the World Trade
Organization (WTO), giving the world a competitive
labor force and manufacturing capability.

Despite this path towards integration, many counter
trends were simmering in the background, including
the rise of middle powers challenging the status quo.
These trends developed and became exacerbated
by recent events like the war in Ukraine and the
impacts of Covid. As a result, new supply chains are
now being created while old ones are being diverted.
The transition to a new model will
be costly and last years, at least until new industrial
plants in burgeoning industries come online and new
economies of scale are generated.

To steer their companies in this new environment,
leaders need to reexamine outdated business
models. ",,0

the economic slowdown will be more
pronounced than in the US.
By mid-2023, our central scenario is that
the labour market correction in the US will
have curbed wage growth and slowed
down inflation. In Europe, the decoupling
from Russian gas should be well under
way, reducing energy costs and restoring
confidence. However, we find it difficult to
imagine a return to the previous state of
affairs in terms of central banks policies.

",,0
538,"Securing adequate insurance coverage
Strategic direction is key to securing effective insurance coverage. Organizations should
consider how their risks change as they move further along their strategic plan, which
allows them to overlay a risk framework and map it back to insurance. In building the plan,
organizations should seek advisors to consult on technology best practices and digital asset
regulations. Performing this due diligence will not only help organizations better understand
their current and potential exposures, but may also put them in a more favorable position
with underwriters.

Both directors and officers liability (D&O) and errors and omissions (E&O) insurance
policies — which most organizations already purchase — typically provide protection for
digital asset exposures and typically do not require additional affirmative coverage. Even so,
it is advisable for organizations to be proactive by informing insurers before entering this
space and being prepared to answer their questions. If an insurer discovers an organization’s
digital asset exposure only when a claim is being made, it can damage the organization’s
relationship with the insurer, potentially leading to exclusions on future policies.

Cyber incidents, such as IT outages, ransomware attacks

followed by ransomware attacks and failure of digital

With global cooperation under threat, experts
are calling for closer public-private

Frédéric de Courtois : Historically, governments
defined norms and regulation, while insurance
companies provided capital. Given the rise of major
risks and their potentially systemic nature, greater
collaboration has become crucial and some
governments have set up public-private partnerships
(PPPs) with the insurance sector. It is the case in
France: together with insurance companies, public
authorities cover extreme risks related to natural
catastrophes and, more recently, to agricultural
disasters.

2023 risk issues

For 2023, concern about specific risk issues is varied, as

reflected by their ratings of the 38 risks at the highest

impact level (red circles). For 2023, board members, CAEs

and CIOs/CTOs are most concerned about operational

issues. CIOs/CTOs report four “Significant Impact” risks,

board members report three and CAEs two. CEOs are

most concerned about strategic risks and report four

“Significant Impact” risks. CIOs/CTOs also identify two

strategic risks as high impact. For macroeconomic risks,

CAEs rate two risks at the “Significant Impact” level, while

board members and Other C-Suite executives identify

one macroeconomic risk as elevated. ",,1

Commission and Canadian government employees. 47,48 Though the actual degree of risk

associated with these apps is opaque, the stance taken by these governments is a clear

sign of growing mistrust and suspicion.

Increased diplomatic tensions around espionage activities are also in the mix. A planned

diplomatic visit to China by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was called off in

February after an incident with an alleged Chinese surveillance balloon sighted in U.S.

airspace. 49 The high level of publicity seems to have forestalled any efforts to ease

tensions and normalize relations for the time being. Security concerns are cropping up in

a range of commercial contexts, with efforts to stop agricultural projects such as a

proposed corn mill in North Dakota due to its proximity to a U.S. Air Force base. 50 Some

states are calling for broad bans on real estate purchases by Chinese nationals as well. 51

572,"Japan announced a proposal to
double its defence budget to $105 billion (2% of
its GDP) in May last year, and Qatar has increased
spending by 434% since 2010 in response to
blockades.52 The war in Ukraine – as well as
lukewarm condemnation by a few key geopolitical
players – has driven recent pledges by NATO
members to meet or exceed the target of 2% of

GDP, which, if met by all members, would represent
an increase in total budget by 7% in real terms.53
Widespread defence spending, particularly on
research and development, could deepen insecurity
and promote a race between global and regional
powers towards more advanced weaponry.54

The private sector is set to increasingly drive the
development of military technologies, yielding
advancements in semiconductor manufacturing,
AI, quantum computing, biotechnology and even
nuclear fusion, among other technologies.55 Many
of these are general purpose in nature with civilian
applications, but are also a force multiplier of military
power, enhancing the capabilities of autonomous
weapons, cyberwarfare and defensive capabilities.

573,"As the extended ramifications of the conflict
continue to unravel, this lack of attention to
such a key risk seems either short-sighted
or untenable.

The conflict has forced businesses into
swift, often large-scale action. Organisations
with ties to Russian businesses and
the government severed them. Some
organisations sold Russian subsidiaries at
rock-bottom prices while others scrambled
to source supplies of goods and services from
outside the country. In response to sanctions
by the European Union, the United Kingdom
and the United States, Russia cut its supplies
of oil to Bulgaria, Finland and Poland –
pushing up prices. At the time of writing this
report, the situation is highly volatile.

The war has also impacted financial
liquidity and insolvency risk. While ranked
ninth considered as the top risk facing
organisations in the Risk in Focus 2023 survey
(down from sixth last year), the risk scored
fifth when considered as a direct impact
of the conflict in Ukraine. The crisis comes
at a time when Europe is winding down its
unprecedented €2.3 trillion1 aid package for
businesses and governments across the zone
and inflation – stoked by a cocktail of rising
energy costs, wages and food prices – is on

Climate mitigation and climate
adaptation efforts are set up for a
risky trade-off, while nature

Climate and environmental risks are the core focus of
global risks perceptions over the next decade – and
are the risks for which we are seen to be the least
prepared. The lack of deep, concerted progress on
climate targets has exposed the divergence between
what is scientifically necessary to achieve net zero
and what is politically feasible. Growing demands
on public-and private-sector resources from other
crises will reduce the speed and scale of mitigation
efforts over the next two years, alongside insufficient
progress towards the adaptation support required
for those communities and countries increasingly
affected by the impacts of climate change.

As current crises diverts resources from risks arising

As organizations explore augmented reality and immersive opportunities within the
metaverse, they should consider taking the following actions:

Stay abreast of regulatory
developments to determine
potential responsibilities
and learn from emerging
cases that may establish
liability trends. It is
critical to closely follow
regulatory classifications
that may impact the use
of the metaverse or digital
currencies used to buy and
sell items in the metaverse.

Be clear about the
geographical jurisdiction
that applies. Understand
that users in different
parts of the world may
be protected by different
types of laws. This is
especially important when
considering data privacy
laws, which have historically
depended significantly on
geographical location.

Keep up with emerging
technologies that can
impact metaverse adoption.
As headsets, haptic
wearables, and other
technologies become
more affordable and userfriendly, the number of
customers that can access
metaverse platforms is
expected to grow. But
metaverse-related risks
will also increase.

Exploration of the metaverse has only begun. The potential for growth is immense, as are the
potential opportunities for organizations. As they explore these opportunities, businesses
should not lose sight of potential risks, both existing and emerging.",,0
580,"Personal-Data-Related Regulatory Fragmentation

Key Risk Indicators

• Most enterprises plan to deploy AI or machine learning (ML) for the first time by

1Q24, and a quarter have already done so.

• As such, organizations have little time to improve their data governance before AI

becomes embedded into business capabilities.

• Insufficient oversight of data used by AI can pose a wide variety of risks, including

in the compliance, reputational and cyber domains.

• Number of known AI capabilities embedded in the organization

• Number of product features deployed and in development that rely on AI

capabilities

• Frequency of model performance monitoring

• Number of approved exceptions to data

and analytics policies

• Frequency of authorized third-party access

to PII

• Though the number of regulations over personal data governance have been rising

steadily for some time, 2023 presents new-in-kind challenges for personal data

compliance.

• U.S. laws also differ from the EU’s GDPR in that the former require “opt-out”

preferences, to sell personal information, and the latter requires “consent.”

• Governments’ use of data localization requirements (to host data within a country

or region) is also increasing. Some countries plan to protect privacy (e.g.",,0
581,"In developed nations,
high prices will lead governments to prioritize energy
security over emissions reductions. In developing nations,
especially in Asia and Latin America, the high price

and severity, emerging market calls for financial support
from advanced economies for climate adaptation and loss
and damage compensation will grow louder but largely
go unheeded, and international climate cooperation will
continue to falter.

In short, the respite in energy markets this winter will be
temporary—the eye of the hurricane before a renewed
energy crunch adds to pressure on consumers, puts fiscal
strain on governments, and deepens divides between
developed and developing nations and the United States
and Gulf countries.

were once celebrated as a hallmark of free trade and
economic efficiency, they can now be perceived as a
vulnerability in need of reshaping amidst rising
geopolitical competition. In the name of building

attempts to onshore or “friendshore” procurement in
critical industries, such as tech (semiconductors),

Skills Shortage
and Reskilling

Skills shortages across different industries are difficult to identify and measure, resulting in the impact on

insurance claims possibly going unnoticed and unattributed. Engineering and medical skill mismatches and

shortages have been reported for decades and are now exacerbated by retirement waves and technological

advances. In the absence of lifelong learning and adaptation to new technologies and work trends, more

industries could see a growing skills gap. For Property and Casualty business, skills shortages may result

in the inability to sustain risk prevention measures, longer business interruption periods and more product

failures. Inappropriate decisions or mistakes made by inexperienced or overworked medical personnel,

could lead to an increase in medical malpractice claims. For Life business, this could mean unanticipated

deteriorations in mortality and morbidity. From an operational perspective, the insurance industry relies on

highly skilled actuaries, loss adjusters, underwriters and asset managers. Mental health impacts on over-tired

or under-skilled employees could be a longer-term consequence.

more resilient is to develop alternative and/or multiple

geographical diversification of supplier networks in
response to geopolitical trends is the third most common

Measuring
innovation gains
The chief audit executive at an
international IT company agrees that
these can be potential problems but says
that it is not for the audit team to set the
balance between innovation and risk -
that is the role of management. “Chief
audit executives should help by bringing
visibility and assess whether different
types of innovation efforts are more or
less productive,” he says. “Or whether
they are well-aligned to achieving strategic
objectives.”

On a practical level, auditors should
help measure how much financial value
innovation creates for the business. ",,0

Agility of risk

“Sanctions of this scale and complexity are a
nightmare to police,” Foyle says. Since they
originate from different jurisdictions and
apply to both organisations and individuals,
simply keeping risk assessments up to date
can be challenging. Businesses must map
the restrictions imposed by all countries
across their global enterprise - including
those relating to sources of funding. ",,0

the direct impact of climate change has
become more and more undeniable: July
2022 saw record-breaking heatwaves in
Europe, with temperatures reaching 45.7°C
in Spain, hundreds of heat-related deaths in
Portugal, and almost 346,000 hectares of
land ravaged by wildfires. In Japan,
meanwhile, a heatwave put such pressure
on the electricity grid that people were
asked to switch off lights and ration
air-conditioning to avoid power cuts.

Respondents highlight that more extreme
climate conditions are likely to lead to an
increase in forced migration, exacerbating
geopolitical tensions in some regions.

In our survey, we asked experts to rate the
pace of emergence of each risk: “already
there”, “rapidly emerging” or “slowly
emerging”. The proportion saying climate
change is “already there” jumped from 46%
last year to 54% this year. Experts also take
a dimmer view of public authorities’
preparedness, with only 14% saying they
are well prepared – down from 19% in last
year’s survey.

Getting a handle on current levels of activity and
exposure to geopolitical developments is an important
building block, especially if this hasn't been a subject
of active thought for the C-suite and the board. One
way to do this is to conduct a geopolitical stress test
on the strategy and planned initiatives. A CEO could
take their company's 3-year business plan and model
future scenarios (individually or collectively) to get an
idea of their exposure and resilience.

Implement a geopolitical risk assessment,
forecasting and monitoring solution

For companies that truly want to feel they have a handle
on geopolitical risk, they should go beyond relying on
mass media for information and invest in specialized
geopolitical forecasting and monitoring capabilities
that focus on the politics that really matter to the
organization. There are tools (including DRA) available
to help companies navigate this landscape with support
from specialized teams of political analysts focused on
covering politics in real-time and the expertise to
translate those into business implications.

2023 technology industry outlook

Faced with ebbing product demand, decreasing consumer spending,
and falling valuations, tech company C-suites may feel enormous
pressure to reduce their costs and improve profitability. They’re
responding in many ways: conducting strategic reviews of talent,
modernizing their tech infrastructure, and looking for bargains in
M&A. Tech leaders should consider a mix of approaches that could
enable them to emerge from a downturn with the right tech, talent,
and growth opportunities in place.

Notably, Q4 2022 saw hiring freezes and layoffs sweep through
the sector.6 After hiring aggressively to meet demand during boom
years, leaders are now aiming to right-size their workforces.7 But
right-skilling continues to be just as critical: 58% of technology
decision-makers Deloitte surveyed reported that recruiting talent
is a major challenge, and 48% said the same about retaining
personnel.8 The workforce reductions may have an upside for
smaller, growing tech companies by providing opportunities to
acquire newly available talent.

are comparatively less impacted, either due to
contained climate impacts for now, or leveraging of
rapid innovation to address food and water security
challenges.18 Free-flowing global supply chains have
helped distribute the overall hit to food production
levels, but the most resource-insecure countries are
those vulnerable to two prolonged crises: debt and
climate change. Given the extended capital flight
earlier in the decade, and without the fiscal space to
speed up adaptation measures (see Chapter 1.2,
Economic downturn), these countries have become
even more heavily import-dependent, unable to scale
food production to meet the demands of population
growth, given water stress and deteriorated soil
conditions.

Green-energy supply is also at risk. Companies
mining critical metals and minerals in water-stressed
regions face regular interruptions to operations or

intervention in markets to reduce the impact on
consumers. The Russian invasion of Ukraine highlighted

areas that are digitalising and, perhaps,
measuring any increase in value of its

internal auditors must ensure that they
understand the alignment of the culture of
innovation with the organisation’s strategic
goals - a task that does not necessarily
require deep technical expertise to exist in
the function’s team.

Valuing data
Unlike digital-first companies, many
organisations have legacy systems that
are poorly integrated. In practice, that
can mean the same customer is often
dealing with multiple departments in an
organisation, but their data is spread over
separate systems.

“The fragmentation of the data landscape
is a key barrier to digitalisation in any
large organisation that has not been built
on a newer digital platform,” Shehryar
Humayun, audit director - applications,
data and applied sciences at Lloyds
Banking Group, says.

He says that culturally, organisations tend
not to prioritise their data because it
is costly to do so and seems less of a
priority than, say, creating new business
propositions. ",,0

the WHO projects a decline in the estimated global health

workforce shortage to 10 million in 2030, compared with

a 15 million workforce shortage the WHO projected for

2020, the International Council of Nurses notes that the

pandemic is driving up demand for nurses, particularly in

destination countries, and will drive increased outflow of

nurses from low- and middle-income countries.15

Innovative strategies are needed to change the course of

this trend and meet current and future staffing demand

through different approaches to recruit, hire, train,

retain and support the workforce. Strategies should be

developed and adopted across a variety of areas including

a healthy work environment; diversity, equity and inclusion

ever-changing risk landscape and the overall perceived

senior executives to closely scrutinize the approaches they

use to keep an eye on risks emerging around the corner.

Unfortunately, some organizations continue to manage

risks the way they have for many years, even though the

profile of risks is evolving. As business transforms because

of the rapidly advancing digital economy and, for many

organizations, the transition to permanent hybrid work

environments that was accelerated by the pandemic, the

risk profile is most certainly not yesterday's risks. A focus

on financial and compliance risks using static analog-age

tools without any conception of the organization’s risk

appetite leaves decision makers across the organization to

their own devices. Soon those organizations may realize,

once it’s too late, that their level of investment in risk

management and willingness to engage in robust tools to

identify, manage and monitor risk are inadequate.

Diseases

Pathogens are constantly evolving, and the impacts of climate change, trade and travel networks,

demographic factors as well as human agricultural and forestry practices are creating new opportunities

for them. There are direct risks from new diseases for human morbidity and mortality including potential

pandemics, especially for pathogens that poorly understood, highly contagious and difficult to treat and

that interact with populations previously not exposed to them. Pandemics can also have a significant effect

on the whole economic and financial landscape, but the large number of variables influencing the outcome,

including non-medical interventions, supply-chain resilience, and political positions, is making it difficult

for insurers to predict the severity of the next pandemic. Pathogens affecting major food crops (but also

growing importance

Endocrine
Disruptors

at #7. However, elsewhere it is a different picture. Across
Africa and Middle East, climate change rises to #4 from
#10 year-on-year. In Asia Pacific it climbs to #5 from #6.

The Allianz Risk Barometer results also show that
companies are still taking action when it comes to risk
mitigation. According to respondents, the top three actions
firms are taking to combat the direct impact of climate
change are: adopting carbon-reducing business models
(e.g. switching to renewable energy sources); developing
a dedicated risk management strategy for climate risks;
and creating contingency plans for climate changerelated eventualities, such as assessing critical systems
and resources.

Climate change and global warming threaten companies
in a number of different ways. First and foremost, higher
property damage and business interruption risks as a
result of natural hazards and extreme weather events
such as floods, storms, thunderstorms or droughts. Then
there is the threat of legal and liability risks due to the
comprehensive regulatory framework around the world,
increasing disclosure requirements, and the threat of
greenwashing accusations or climate lawsuits.

612,"Therefore, all
organizations are already encouraged to ensure they
have appropriate governance structures in place to

provide reliable and useful information on their
ESG risks and opportunities.

Organizations should define their ESG disclosures
and metrics and identify the data to be captured and
curated in order to comply with new European and
local ESG regulations in a timely manner.

The role of Internal Audit
For organizations that are in the early stages of their
ESG journey, internal audit should provide advisory
support in understanding ESG risks, and support
the design and development of robust governance
frameworks and control environments.

For organizations further progressed on their ESG
journey, internal audit should provide assurance on
relevant governance frameworks, organizational
strategies, and the integrity of ESG reporting.
Compliance with ESG risk management and
applicable legislative requirements should be

and potentially exacerbate existing and emerging risks (see Figure 3). Aside from potentially
slowing down production, delaying the release of new products or services, and slowing sales
of current offerings, a stretched or distracted workforce can heighten cybersecurity risks. In
the year ending April 2022 there were more than 714,000 job openings for cybersecurity roles
or skills posted in the US. The global shortage is believed to be 3.4 million.

Human error, for example, is a major contributor to cyber breaches, and believed to be the
root cause of the vast majority of cybersecurity breaches. Mercer’s People Risks 2022 report
found that cybersecurity and data privacy is the top people risk for communications, media,
and technology companies. ",1.0,0
614,"It is interesting to note that three of the top 10 risk issues

for manufacturing and distribution organizations relate

specifically to culture. The world has shifted. As a result,

board members and leadership within these organizations

are seeking to understand whether their culture and people

are shifting with it. Such changes are not new in the industry

group. Since evolving from operating in a farming economy

to an industrial machine economy, these companies have had

to reinvent their business models and cultures historically.

They now face greater demand for hybrid and remote work

models, emerging technologies (including AI and machine

learning), ESG and DEI programs, and other initiatives that

directly affect the organization’s culture.

Overview of top risk issues in 2032

Interestingly, the 10-year outlook in this year’s survey is

significantly riskier than this same outlook from last year’s

study. Whereas in the 2031 view from last year’s survey

there were no risk issues rated at the “Significant Impact”

level, all of the top five risks for 2032 are ranked at this level.

In comparison with perceptions for 2023, there are some

similar themes in the risk outlook for a decade out. ",,1

In the years to come, as continued, concurrent

other risks that we face. More than four in five
GRPS respondents anticipate consistent volatility
over the next two years at a minimum, with multiple
shocks accentuating divergent trajectories. However,
respondents are generally more optimistic over
the longer term. Just over one-half of respondents
anticipate a negative outlook, and nearly one in five
respondents predict limited volatility with relative – and
potentially renewed – stability in the next 10 years.

Indeed, there is still a window to shape a more

ability to align policies and processes around recruiting,

retention, career advancement and reward systems with

priorities surrounding diversity, equity and inclusion

(DEI) are relatively the same this year compared to last

risks. This risk is the 24th-rated risk overall for 2023,

compared with ranking 10th for 2022. It ranks 31st for

2032 compared with 15th for 2031.

• Climate change risk has increased but is a priority

primarily for fossil fuels-based companies. Concerns

over the growing focus on climate change and related

ESG policies, regulations and expanding disclosure

requirements have increased overall this year. However,

at this time most respondents do not anticipate changes

to their organizations’ strategies and business models

from climate-related matters with as much concern

as they view the implications of other risks. This risk

increases looking out longer term, ranking 20th 10

years out in this year's survey (down from 19th last

year). Concerns related to climate change are greatest

in industries concentrated in fossil fuels generation and

use. A related point is that a lack of focus on climate

matters could present talent retention challenges for

younger generations.

",,1
617,"In parallel, the frequency and severity
of heatwaves and droughts has forced green energy
sources – biofuels, hydropower and nuclear – into
periodic production cuts, and some are on the verge
of becoming stranded assets. Electrical supply has
been destabilized in the near-term for many countries,

including Brazil, South Africa, China, Germany and the
United States of America, increasingly turning these
markets towards alternate energy sources.

Even in the absence of geopolitically fuelled shocks
or constraints, continued price pressures on food,
water and energy have resulted in an elongated
cost-of-living crisis in selected markets, ushering in
wage strikes, violent protests and state instability.
Socioeconomic impacts have also begun to spread
to more advanced economies, with a risk of partial
deindustrialization caused by combined energy-water
shortages. The shutdown of waterborne transport
of trade is more regularly disrupting global supply
chains, placing pressure on road and rail transports
and dampening global economic growth.19 Energy-
and water-intensive strategic industries, such as
semiconductor manufacturing, located in resourceinsecure areas, have become new geopolitical
hotspots, raising the risk of prolonged disputes and
possible conflicts.

Economic slowdown
challenging tech growth
The ever-increasing reliance on technology and connectivity has propelled
tremendous growth in the tech industry. But as countries recovered from the
COVID-19 pandemic, 2022 brought new challenges. Record rates of inflation,
interest rate hikes, and the prospect of a global recession now threaten
the tech industry’s continued growth. Global information technology
spending is forecast to have grown less than 1% in 2022, down from
10.2% the previous year.
With capital markets largely paused as they keep a close watch on economic indicators, many tech startups face the prospect of
stalled growth. Even established firms are looking closely at expenses and signaling a slowdown. Many major tech companies
recently reduced their workforces through headline-grabbing layoffs, while others adjusted their 2023 growth goals downward
and indicated they will reduce or freeze hiring.

Valuations also declined significantly as the overall market became more volatile. ",,0
620,"Eyes on the sky: worries about extreme weather threats

Energy and utilities executives may be worrying less

about climate change policies, regulations and expanding

disclosure requirements, but they are very concerned

about their companies facing operational challenges due

to extreme weather threats. Ranking first on the list of top

risks for the industry in 2023 and 2032 is a new addition to

our survey: “The rising threat associated with catastrophic

natural disasters and weather phenomena may create

significant operational challenges that threaten our assets,

employees, and our ability to deliver products and services

to our customers.”

While this risk isn’t in the top 10 list for the overall survey

results for either 2023 or 2032, it’s understandable

why it ranks as the number one concern for energy and

utilities firms for the year ahead — and for the next

decade. Extreme weather events around the globe are

taxing, disrupting and, in many cases, outright destroying

critical energy infrastructure, including renewable energy

infrastructure. These events can impact energy companies’

operations in other ways, as well, from preventing essential

staff from reaching critical worksites to sidelining company

communications.

The Global Risks Perception Survey (GRPS) is the
World Economic Forum’s source of original risks
data, harnessing the expertise of the Forum’s
extensive network of academic, business,
government, civil society and thought leaders.
Survey responses were collected from 7 September
to 5 October 2022 from the World Economic
Forum’s multistakeholder communities.

Updates to the GRPS 2022-2023

The list of 32 global risks included in the survey was
updated in 2022.

Two new risks were added in response to observed
economic, geopolitical and environmental trends:

1. “Cost-of-living crisis”

2. “Misinformation and disinformation”

In addition, “Climate action failure” was delineated
into two separate risks:

1. “Failure of climate-change adaption”

623,"Domestic food inflation in more than 60 countries is
reportedly 15 percent higher year on year, and about
60 percent of low-income countries find themselves in,
or at high risk of, debt distress.

Agricultural output will be affected by a lack of
fertilizers given Russian supply shocks, high energy
prices, and the effect of massive droughts in 2022.
Critical grain exports from Ukraine are particularly
vulnerable as Russia might reinstate blockades to
pursue military goals. Net food importers will be
exposed as governments will be encouraged to
impose food export restrictions. For example,
Indonesia announced export restrictions on palm oil to
boost its domestic use for biofuel. As they account for
50 percent of global production, the measure is likely
to shoot up prices of what is traditionally the cheapest
edible oil in the region for importers such as Malaysia,
India, Vietnam, and Pakistan. More protests like those
seen in Sri Lanka last year might erupt. The hope is
that supply chains and consumer preferences can shift
fast enough. Switching from sunflower oil to other
vegetable oils or from wheat to millet, for example,
could help in building resilience.

The distributional impact of the Covid-19 crisis has increased income and wealth gaps within and across

countries. In particular, the younger generation has been impacted by declining education, job prospects,

or mental well-being, with possible negative consequences for their lifelong income and hence insurance

demand. Now, the war in Ukraine is putting further strain on energy and food prices, which could spill over

into social unrest, particularly in low- and lower-middle-income countries; this risk is aggravated by elevated

debt levels and stretched social safety nets post Covid-19. This would impact financial markets, potential

output as well as insurance demand.

Developing de-risking actions

A shorter business cycle should be positive
for mitigating business interruption (BI) and
supply chain risks. “The time it takes to create
and execute business models for products and
services will shorten significantly in coming
years, which should help build resilience in
the long run,” Pachov adds. “Change creates
awareness and transparency within businesses,
which are key denominators for a good risk
philosophy and good risk management.”

Another positive development is an enhanced

risks in general: climate change is
their top-ranked risk, with pollution

They are also more interested than
average in liability issues (15% vs 11%

growing tendency for young people to see

It is my pleasure to bring you
this year’s Future Risks Report
in collaboration with our

colleagues at AXA and IPSOS.
Maybe that’s not quite the right
sentiment. After all, 2022 was
supposed to be a year of normalization
as the world emerged from the
pandemic.

Enter geopolitics. Instead, 2022
became the year when war erupted
in Europe, as Russia invaded Ukraine.
It was also the year when high
inflation returned, as massive stimulus
in the developed world – particularly
the United States – collided with

a drawn-out Covid pandemic, lingering
supply constraints, and high energy
prices pushed up by the war.

Households are concerned about their
ability to pay for essentials such as
food and energy. The general public
is also apprehensive about the future
and less confident that it is worth
taking personal and professional risks
in such an uncertain environment.

",,0
642,"There is also strong bipartisan support for Ukraine in Washington, despite growing populist-right and progressive-left
wariness of a “blank check” in US aid. Even with a majority in one chamber of Congress, Republicans will not block all
new aid this year, and Congress will approve potential requests for smaller, military-focused packages. Such support
will be tied to specific needs and conditioned on greater oversight of aid deployment, clarity on the US endgame, and
increased EU contributions. Bipartisan consensus in the US on backing Kyiv will underpin continued transatlantic
commitment to seek peace on Ukraine’s terms.
27 eurasia group  TOP RISKS 2023

For their part, most EU members see Russia’s attack on
Ukraine as a fundamental challenge to Europe’s future.
Washington’s strong support for both Kyiv and NATO
allies will be a constant reminder of the US security
umbrella shielding Europe from hostilities, thereby
dampening appetite for more EU strategic autonomy.
Though European views diverge on how the war should
end, EU members will not break ranks with Washington
in deferring to Kyiv on peace talks.

Despite bearing the brunt of the war’s economic fallout,
European allies will also increase defense spending, in
line with US demands. ",,0

Organizational Resilience

Risk Definition

Organizational resilience is the ability to resist, absorb, recover and adapt to business

disruption in an ever-changing and increasingly complex environment. The outbreak of a

land-based conflict in Europe with the Russian invasion of Ukraine has highlighted the

massive disruptive potential of geopolitical events. Recent escalations in tension between

the U.S. and China present another front of possible disruption. Organizations also face

financial and operational uncertainties on the economic front, as macroeconomic events

have defied the logic of traditional theories.

Driver 1: Growing U.S.-China Tensions

The growing rivalry between the U.S. and China has been described by some experts as a

“new Cold War.” 38,39,40,41 Events since the publication of our Hot Spots report in September

2022 have contributed to mounting tensions. One of the most contentious issues is

Taiwanese sovereignty. Another is the impact of growing Chinese assertiveness as a

military power. For example, in December 2022, China conducted military exercises near

Taiwan, including sending fighter jets over the Taiwan Strait; in February 2023, Chinese

fighter jets shadowed an American patrol aircraft. ",,0

countries.5 The continued expansion into secure,
renewable energy and related infrastructure will also
drive exponential demand for finite critical metals and
minerals.6 Significant even in absolute terms, annual
demand for these resources, such as graphite,
lithium and cobalt, is anticipated to hit 450% of 2018
production levels by 2050.7

Together, the set of emerging demand and supply
concerns around natural resources are already
becoming an area of growing alarm. GRPS
respondents identified strong relationships and twoway linkages between “Natural resource crises”
and the other risks identified in previous chapters
(Figure 3.1), pointing to the potential polycrisis that
may evolve over the medium term.

respected and are not subjected to unfair

can indicate that the culture is moving in
the right direction.

The roadmap should also show how
the desired cultural behaviours are
embedded in an organisation’s processes,
and are aligned with clear roles and
responsibilities, as well as being assigned
to individual accountabilities. But chief
audit executives agreed that from the
outset of any cultural change programme
the tone from the top was key. “Staff
want to be proud of management and the
organisation’s ethical conduct,” said one
chief audit executive. “Management can
drive a big difference in behaviour.”

The organisational culture must be clearly
articulated throughout the business.
",,0
648,"This is

an opportunity for positive change and growth. As part of

these efforts, position an advocate for the preservation

of talent and culture at the decision-making table as the

organization focuses on sustaining its financial health.

• Be prudent and thoughtful in decision-making. Should a

recession inhibit growth:

– Pursue all appropriate measures to preserve

operating margin before moving forward with

talent cuts. For example, reduce other SG&A costs,

consider outsourcing noncore activities, sell noncore

assets, adjust base and incentive compensation and

benefits, etc.

– Focus on retaining “A” players by designing and de
ploying repeatable assessments of the organizational

talent and skills needed to exit a recession in a strong

position to capitalize on market opportunities.

– Be mindful of the employee experience and employee

well-being by aligning these areas with the customer

experience in ways that, to the extent possible, reflect

the organization’s unique employee value proposition.

Also, maximize the flexibility of work arrangements.

• Treat people like people. Should workforce reductions

and changes to hiring practices (e.g., a hiring freeze)

become necessary, make decisions objectively and

approach them smartly. There is a right and wrong way

to approach these matters.

– Communicate thoughtfully and frequently.

",,0
649,"These significant steps confirm that the global
community recognizes that the risks associated
with nature loss, food production, energy generation
and climate change cannot be fully mitigated in
isolation. However, the translation into public- and
private-sector action remains to be seen, particularly
given limited progress on previous biodiversity – and
climate – targets to date.

Although the relationship between climate and nature
heightens the likelihood of a series of escalating and
potentially irreversible feedback loops, it can equally
be leveraged to broaden the impact of risk mitigation
activities. Given increasing financial and capacity
trade-offs, investment in resilience must focus
on solutions that build preparedness for multiple
risks. By restoring biodiversity in soils, for example,
regenerative agriculture has the potential to store
large amounts of carbon.

A focus on biodiversity preservation should drive and
prioritize local adaptation and community resilience
– and in doing so, contribute to the mitigation of
climate change globally. Altered land management
practices like afforestation, micro-irrigation and
agroforestry are a low-cost way to increase resilience
to extreme weather. The protection and restoration
of marine biodiversity, such as mangrove systems,
can enhance rather than compete with domestic
food web productivity and security. ",,1
650,"This approach involves more stakeholder
engagement across multiple divisions of
the organisation, and is often cumbersome
and more expensive to resolve, but when
done right it solves the organisation’s
strategic data risks rather data risk in a

DIGITAL DISRUPTION

“The fragmentation of the
data landscape is a key
barrier to digitalisation in
any large organisation that

such as privacy, ethics, data by design,
data retention, metadata and other areas.
This arrangement ensures the teams have
experience of both understanding the
power of harnessing data and being able
to highlight the impact of data challenges.
“Audit has a brilliant vantage point under
this arrangement to take a holistic view
across the organisation and to help it
on its journey to get to grips with a
fragmented data landscape with legacy
tech in a practical way,” he says.

",,0
651,"On oil, a faster-than-expected economic recovery in China driven by the country’s sudden exit from zero-Covid policies,
combined with only a shallow recession in the United States that will not cause demand destruction, will increase crudeoil demand growth and expose an acute lack of new supply. Contributing to the problem are Russian production declines
amid continued sanctions, low levels of OPEC+ spare capacity, reduced capital investment in non-OPEC production, and
the absence of an Iran nuclear deal (please see risk #5). The supply shocks anticipated in 2022 will drive crude prices
above $100 per barrel before the end of the year.

On gas, the European Union’s need to rebuild gas storage from the second quarter of 2023 in the absence of cheap Russian
supplies will create new competition for LNG and more demand for pipeline gas from Norway and North Africa. That will
drive up prices, especially for Europe but also indirectly in North America, Asia, and other regional markets. Markets in
Europe already price in almost $50 per million British thermal units (MMBTU) next summer; the price is likely to spike
higher as China’s growth recovers and global demand for LNG increases. ",,0
652,"An increase in data breaches
is expected this year, cyber security firm Norton Labs
predicts3, as criminals are finding ways to breach standard
multi-factor authentication technologies.

An increase in ransomware attacks ranks as the second
most important concern (50%). Around the world, the
frequency of attacks remains high, as do related claims
costs. The cost of ransomware attacks has increased
as criminals have targeted larger companies, supply
chains and critical infrastructure – in April 2022 an attack
impacted around 30 institutions of the government of
Costa Rica, crippling the territory for two months4. Double
and triple extortion attacks are now the norm – besides the
encryption of systems, sensitive data is increasingly stolen
and used as a leverage for extortion demands to business
partners, suppliers or customers.

A combination of saturation in consumer markets
and constrained average revenue per user (ARPU)
growth means many operators are prioritizing growth
opportunities in the enterprise segment.

But this focus on business-to-business (B2B) has yet to deliver meaningful growth.
One reason is that the higher-growth products and services — the likes of IoT,
cloud and security — still account for a relatively low share of overall B2B revenues.
Margins in some of these can also be limited by a reliance on partnerships. And
the worsening macroeconomic outlook is a further issue, particularly among
smaller businesses.

Monetary
Policies

Since last year the supply-demand conditions driving the monetary stance of central banks has

fundamentally changed – from disinflation (due to declining consumption and investment as the Covid-19

crisis deepened, amplifying structurally low pre-crisis demand) to excess inflation (due to rising energy and

commodities prices as well as continued supply chain disruptions propagated by the Covid-19 re-opening

dynamics and the Ukraine war). For most of the last year, most central banks dismissed rising inflation as

temporary. And since monetary policy influences inflation mainly via demand (through higher rates) rather

than supply, they accepted that inflation might overshoot for a short period until supply constraints go

away. However, the incipient fragmentation of the global system (with companies building more resilient but

less efficient supply chains, geo-strategic on-shoring of technologies, and severe disruptions to the energy

market) could result in a persistent cost-push shock. Thus, pursuing a strategy of “looking through” without

losing credibility has become exceedingly difficult. ",,1

to two key privacy risks: re-identification and attribute
disclosure.94 Research suggests that 99.98% of US
residents could be correctly re-identified in any data
set – including those that are heavily sampled and
anonymized – using 15 demographic attributes.95
Researchers have used this theory to uncover the
political preferences of streaming users,96 match
DNA from publicly-available research databases to
randomly selected individuals,97 and link medical

In consequential terms, this means that an
international organization may share anonymized data
with partner governments to support effective and
efficient crisis responses. However, when combined
with other data sets, it could allow the identification
and tracking of vulnerable refugees and displaced
persons – or compromise the location of camps

“However, the US, China, Germany, Italy and Brazil are
still registering prolonged low levels of insolvencies, but
the trend should reverse in 2023.”

Europe will be particularly impacted again by this
anticipated surge: Allianz Trade expects significant rises
in France (+37%), the UK (+9%), Germany (+16%) and
Italy (+33%). In Asia, China is expected to register +15%
more insolvencies in 2023 on the back of low growth

5 RISING VULNERABILITY SEES A LOSS OF TRUST IN EXPERTS AND AUTHORITIES

One of the main lessons of the Future
Risks Report is the growing feeling
of vulnerability and risk aversion
among the general public. The role of
an insurer is to protect its customers
against risks. What message can AXA
send to its clients today in the face
of this feeling of vulnerability
and this growing need for protection?

Claudio Gienal : It’s concerning to see that
such a large proportion of people have low
confidence and feel vulnerable to the risks
that surround us. As a leading insurer, we
aim to give people reassurance by providing
support and helping to protect against
a range of risks.

The report confirms that many people
recognize the safety net insurance provides
and understand its benefits, particularly
in these uncertain times. However, we need
to work hard to raise awareness among
those who perhaps don’t yet understand
the importance of having protection for
what matters to them and how this can help
reduce these feelings of vulnerability.

that is firmly cementing itself among the
hardest challenges businesses face and
internal auditors say that it will rank as the
second largest risk three years from now –
with 21% saying it will be their number
one priority.

Chief audit executives taking part in the
Risk in Focus 2023 roundtable on the issue
agreed that the pandemic had fuelled new

challenges as well as accelerated longer
running trends. In 2023, the global talent
shortage is likely to increase, particularly
for those organisations seeking to employ
people with technical expertise, because
luring people back into workplaces
while ensuring their psychological wellbeing has moved higher up the agenda.
More recently, inflation has moved pay
settlements and industrial action centre
stage – and with the rising operational
costs, some businesses will struggle more
to retain staff.

“Not being able to keep pace with all of the
expectations around social issues and the
impact on organisational culture is a huge
risk,” said one chief audit executive at the
roundtable. ",,0
673,"Linking controls
to environmental
strategy
“Banks’ policies and philosophies on
financing transition, who you will or won’t
do business with is fundamental,” John
Devine, risk committee chair for abrdn,
says. “These decisions are wider than just
climate change, they feed into the entire
ESG agenda.”

Devine says that because the situation is
fluid internal audit must adapt its approach
accordingly. Irrespective of specific new
developments, every organisation must
have a clear strategy, which it can talk
about to investors and “walk the walk.”

“Since every company is making legal,
voluntary and marketing disclosures in these
areas, internal auditors need to make sure
that the control processes underpinning what
a company is saying really resonates back to
the core strategy,” he says, “because the big
risk is that those statements are wrong.”

If banks are lending to coal-burning
companies on the axis of transition, for
example, they must have policies in place
to validate that external business’ carbon
transition plan. Internal audit’s role is to
ensure that the bank has robust controls in
place around those validation processes.

The driver that will continue to push accurate
reporting beyond heavily regulated industries,
Devine believes, is shareholder pressure.

domestic funding – and therefore overall investment

are converting their offerings to a subscription-based XaaS model—

which has the benefits of predictable, recurring revenue streams and
potentially faster revenue growth, plus improved client retention.17

One initiative that many companies undertake as part of their digital
transformation efforts is modernizing legacy systems. These may be
critical to their business, but they are expensive to maintain; susceptible
to hacking; and difficult to integrate with cloud, analytics, and mobility.18
This process may involve re-architecting legacy systems to use cloudnative services, decomposing monolithic code into microservices,

Root Causes Potential Consequences

Extreme Weather

Power grid fragility struggle to meet increasing energy

demand amid more frequent extreme weather events like heat

waves, freezes and flooding.

Continued Russia-Ukraine Conflict

While governments limit energy usage by taxing producers

and enacting consumption quotas, materials to maintain grids

are also in short supply.

State-Sponsored Cyberattacks

Sophisticated attacks intended to cause panic and economic

damage in retaliation for other countries’ foreign policies may

have different ramifications than attacks for profit.

Risk Exposure
Supply Chain Disruption

Sudden cessations of key material deliveries (e.g.,

gasoline/petrol), requiring an increased focus on supply chain

resilience (especially with regards to single points of failure).

Operational Disruptions

Disrupted operations from blackouts or brown-outs,

disruptions to other infrastructure network, or to critical

private-sector institutions (e.g., banks, financial networks).

Increased Compliance Burden and Regulation

New regulations may seek to reduce societal risk from critical

infrastructure failures, possibly affecting supply chains, energy

and other utility services.

EXECUTIVE
SUMMARY

Over the last year, economic and
geopolitical challenges have added a new
layer of uncertainty to the disruptions
caused by the Covid pandemic and the
climate crisis. People around the world
feel more vulnerable to risks, and this
feeling is affecting their priorities and life
choices. Trust and cooperation are more
crucial than ever to avoid breakdowns in
social cohesion.

In this context of growing uncertainties,
what risks most concern people, and who
do they trust to address these risks? The
Future Risks Report 2022 set out to answer
these questions through our regular annual
survey of two groups: experts drawn from
AXA and our professional networks, and
members of the public around the world.
From the findings of the two surveys, we
distil three key lessons.

",,0
687,"Moreover, to the extent that companies provide
third-party assurance as to the computation of the metrics and
the impact on compensation, the audit committee is likely to have
a role in determining the type of assurance that can be provided
as well as who should provide it. Such assurance can provide
positive signals to investors and others regarding the quality and
reliability of disclosures, and audit committees will have a key role
in overseeing assurance engagements.

Post-pandemic challenges: Supply chain
disruption, workforce shortages, and
inflationary pressure
Effects of the economic and other challenges resulting from
the pandemic continue to roil companies and their operations.
Disruptions in global supply chains continue to plague industries
from manufacturing to consumer goods to health care. The audit
committee will need to exercise oversight with regard to how
management is addressing the risks associated with supply chain
disruptions and how the company satisfies the needs of a wide
variety of stakeholders despite the inability to provide products or
services in a timely manner.

Companies in a wide range of industries, regardless of size or other
characteristics, are experiencing workforce shortages, whether
due to historically low rates of unemployment, the so-called “great
resignation,” or other factors. ",,0
688,"They are also prone to fraud; between January 1, 2021 and March 31, 2022, over 46,000
people reported losing over $1 billion in crypto to scams — more than any other payment
method. Although cryptocurrency blockchains are thought to be highly secure, crypto
repositories, such as exchanges and wallets, have been hacked. The technology developers
building or supporting these platforms may face reputational or public trust risks in the event
of a security failure or hacking.

The recent collapse of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange and the broader crypto selloff in
May 2022 shed light on the importance of effective digital asset risk transfer solutions and
insurance protections. Although digital assets share some risks with traditional products and
services, the unique market structure and underlying blockchain technology cause risks to
manifest in novel ways.

Growth of
Leverage

Global debt has risen sharply over the past decade, from $120 trillion in June 2008 to $277 trillion at the

end of 2020, according to the Institute of International Finance (IIF), equivalent to about 365% of the gross

domestic product of the entire global economy. The increase has taken place across the government,

corporate and household sectors driven by, variously, sluggish economic growth and the slow pace of fiscal

consolidation since the Financial Crisis and loose monetary conditions, which has encouraged private sector

borrowers to take on more debt. The increased indebtedness, however, leaves borrowers more vulnerable to

changes in background conditions, such as a slowdown in economic growth, or higher interest; or to market

shocks, for example, a further escalation of the trade war. This heightened credit stress could, in turn, have

further negative consequences, including a spike in defaults (resulting in losses for banks and investors), or

could lead to a period of forced deleveraging that would exacerbate any economic downturn.

RISK FOCUS: ADVANCED AUTOMOTIVE

6 existing and emerging
risks in mobility
Autonomous and electric vehicles have a complex array of components and technologies, from advanced driver assistance systems to
a variety of sensors that gather and relay information to the driver or take control of certain vehicle operations. As a result, the mobility
sector faces a growing set of risks, including:

Data security and privacy
Data is essential to the development and operation of AVs and EVs, as is managing the risks to data security and privacy. But
the possession of data has made companies in all industries vulnerable to cyberattacks as cyber criminals seek to steal data
or extort payments for encrypting or threatening to disclose data.

Systems resiliency and cybersecurity are important considerations for technology companies as well as regulators,
especially for vehicles with higher levels of autonomy. ",,0
693,"For example, in the early
half of the 2020s, the United States was 100%
net import-reliant for 14 critical minerals, including
gallium, natural graphite, indium and vanadium.22
At the time, China was the leading producer for
16 of the 32 strategic minerals, including the
aforementioned resources, representing 98%, 82%,
58% and 66%, respectively, of the world’s total
production.23

With a trend towards remilitarization (see Chapter
2.4: Human security), these strategic resources
have become one of the primary fronts of economic
warfare over the latter half of the decade. Despite
competing fiscal priorities, more states have sought
to diversify supply through domestic extraction
where available, although many face environmental
constraints outlined in Resource collaboration.
Enhanced capacity in processing and refining
has been targeted in particular by states with
limited resource reserves (Figure 3.5). Resilience,
particularly for import-reliant markets, has partially
translated into redundancies, with the building of
stockpiles of key materials exacerbating supply
crises. Inbound investment screening – which only
advanced economies have been able to afford
the opportunity cost – has been expanded to
mining and related industries to minimize foreign
interference. ",,0

•  Resource competition – the danger of
resource autarkies: distrust drives a push
for self-sufficiency in high-income countries,
limiting the need for rivalry over food and water

countries. State intervention is centred on the
resource most exposed to a concentration in
supply – critical metals and minerals – leading
to shortages, price wars and the transformation
of business models across industries. Resource
power shifts, driving the formation of new blocs
as well as wedges in existing alliances between
mineral-rich and -poor countries, while the
potential for accidental or intentional conflict
escalates.

•  Resource control – the danger of resource

taken to shore up national resilience can be selfperpetuating. For example, stockpiling and export
controls can directly exacerbate global shortages

dependencies as a strategic vulnerability, spurring
further disintegration. Similarly, the pursuit of
domestic and global security goals may have
unintended consequences for the geopolitical

landscape, leading to spiralling distrust, declining
safeguards against mutually assured economic
destruction, and currency and technological tools
that are less influential. Even areas traditionally
open to collaboration, such as international climate
research, are under threat. For example, data
regarding Russia’s boreal forests –the biggest landbased carbon store on the planet – is no longer

of the war in Ukraine.11

International organizations will continue to play

will ban other refined petroleum products from February

plans in place in case of any controlled power cuts that
need to be made over the winter – sometimes called
‘load shedding’ or ‘brownouts’. Gas stores in the EU are
at around 90% [as of December 2022], but some analysts
have warned against a short-term outlook when it comes
to the current energy crisis, saying the winter of 2023-2024
could be even worse10.

“In response to the energy crisis, some businesses
have been reducing gas consumption by switching to
LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) or oil, or reactivating or
upgrading redundancy systems that have long been
unused,” explains Stefan Thumm, a Regional Head
of Risk Consulting at AGCS. “This has the potential
to increase the risk of technical failure and change a
company’s risk profile. For example, switching from
a coal supplier in Russia to another global source
could cause issues for boilers because of differences in
coal composition.

the 16th- and ninth-rated risk overall for 2023 and 2032,

respectively, down from 12th and seventh overall for 2022

compliance risks are implicit in other risks our survey

examined, survey participants continue to perceive other

emerging issues at this time in the regulatory landscape that

might affect the manner in which processes are designed and

products or services are produced or delivered.

COVID has reached an endemic state. Risks related to

the pandemic have declined this year, specifically market

conditions imposed by and in response to COVID-19 and

emerging variants.

A long-term outlook helps companies face the future with

confidence. Five of the top 10 risks and six of the top 15

risks over the next decade are not in the top 10 and 15 lists,

respectively, for 2023. Understanding and managing toward

the long view facilitates resilience and agility in pivoting at

the speed of change. This is why the elevation we observe

in the resistance to change in this year’s survey results is

troubling. Complexity and volatility in the risk environment

coupled with the velocity of change comprise a combustible

mix when organizations fail to anticipate and adapt.

May 2023, may restrict certain practices among these core platform

rethink their business models and possibly even divest assets.

Companies that have adopted hybrid work models should also
consider the state- and local-level regulations where their employees
are located. When workers are remote and mobile, companies may
incur unexpected taxes and fees that vary by jurisdiction. According
to a recent Wall Street Journal report, one company discovered this
issue when it was hit with $30,000 in back taxes, fees, and penalties
because an employee worked in two states where the organization
was not registered to do business.61 Adding up the time spent in
meetings and the hours needed for accounting and human resources
to hash out the details, the total cost was closer to $500,000. “We’d
never even thought about these things,” the CEO told the Journal.

Enterprise risk management
Oversight of enterprise risk management (ERM)—the processes
used to identify, monitor, and assess risks—has been on the
audit committee’s agenda for many years. However, this oversight
role may require extra vigilance in 2023, as the pace of change
and the challenges faced by companies seem to increase daily. A
key component of this oversight is the receipt and review by the
committee of a dashboard showing material risks and the degree
of risk associated with each (e.g., red, yellow, and green), as well as
which risks are trending up and down. In addition, the committee
should consider new and emerging risks that have been added to
the dashboard or that may be added in the future.

Aside from general oversight, the audit committee needs to assess
whether the ERM process is evolving to meet the challenges of
the day. ",,0

To determine if perspectives about top risks differ across

executive positions, we separately examined responses

we received from board members and from nine executive

positions with the greatest number of respondents (see

table above). Similar to our analysis of the full sample and

across the different sizes of organizations, we analyze

responses about overall impressions of the magnitude and

severity of risks across executive position held. The scores

in Figure 9 reflect responses to the question about their

overall impressions of the magnitude and severity of risks

their organization will be facing using a 10-point scale

where 1 = “Extremely Low” and 10 = “Extremely High.”

The overall impressions collectively across all executive

positions with respect to the magnitude and severity

of risks in the environment are that the level of risk is

increasing from 2022 and all groups view it as higher than

in 2021. Only CEOs and CIOs/CTOs have lowered their

requires a reporting of opportunities related to both sides
of materiality. With the CSRD, the EU is taking the lead
in sustainability reporting, in line with its claim to be a
regulatory superpower.

In Europe, this aspiration is crystallized in the Corporate
Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), which was
finally adopted in November 2022 and will become
binding for all companies over the coming years –
demanding a great deal of additional effort from
them. This is because the CSRD not only targets the
environmental aspect of economic activity, but also
covers the entire spectrum of sustainability, including
social aspects.

This brings the non-financial factors to the forefront of
reporting, in line with the logic that it is precisely these
factors that become financially material in the long-run. “The
preservation of natural and social foundations is the basis
for all economic activity, and undermining these foundations
will hamper economic success sooner rather than later,” says

remain consumed with domestic challenges—inflation
in the US, slowing growth in China, and a possible global
recession—challenges that would grow exponentially in
the event of a military conflict. Second, China can’t invade
Taiwan without incurring significant US-led sanctions
and losing access to the critical semiconductors that

both China and the US to reduce their interdependence,
the two economies are deeply entangled and will remain
so for the foreseeable future. A near-term military conflict
would guarantee mutually assured economic destruction.

Despite 30 years of global climate advocacy and

The potential failure to address this existential global
risk first entered the top rankings of the Global

atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide, methane and

to limit warming to 1.5°C will be achieved.30

A Failure to mitigate climate change is ranked
as one of the most severe threats in the short term
but is the global risk we are seen to be the least
prepared for, with 70% of GRPS respondents rating

situation would improve even further in the event of

AXA RESEARCH FUND INSIGHTS

Climate change has topped the experts’
rankings every year since 2018, with one
exception: 2020, when the survey was
conducted as the first wave of Covid-19
was sweeping the world and experts put
pandemics and infectious diseases as their
top threat.

This year, for the first time, experts in all
regions selected climate change as their top
threat. Last year, by contrast, American
experts ranked cyber risk in top position
and the pandemic was the top concern for
Asian experts. We see this new unanimity
as a positive step towards consensus across
regions that urgent action is needed:
as the IPCC(1) 2022 report put it, climate
change is a “grave and mounting threat to
our wellbeing and a healthy planet”. (2)

When asked what aspect of climate change
most concerns them, both the general
public (80%) and experts (86%)
overwhelmingly cite physical risks –
such as floods, heatwaves, storms and
rising sea levels – rather than other aspects,
such as risks related to liability for damages
or managing the transition to cleaner
energy.

Risk Definition

China Trade Tensions

The risk that geopolitical tension between China and major trading partners causes supply chain disruptions or increases the

prices of goods and services.

Climate Activism

The risk that institutional investors, collective action by retail investors, or employees may force changes to a company’s

strategy or governance as it relates to the climate.

Cloud Concentration Risk

The risk associated with dependence on a particular cloud provider for multiple business capabilities, such that a single failure

can result in a disruption to multiple aspects of the business.

Critical Infrastructure Failure

The risk that critical infrastructure such as road, bridges, pipelines, power grids etc. fail due to extreme weather, accidents or

cyberattacks.

Decline in Employee Proactivity

The risk of a workforce culture in which employees decline to engage in any activity that goes beyond their strict interpretation

of their own duties (sometimes referred to as ""quiet quitting"").

Evolving Socio-Political

Expectations

The risk that organizations, driven by pressure from customers, investors and/or employees, will need to respond more directly

or to a growing number of social or political issues.

742,"In fact, in November 2022, the SEC’s acting chief
accountant stated that “[t]he current economic environment
is subject to significant uncertainties and, historically, that
oftentimes leads to heightened fraud risk.” 3 In an earlier speech,
he also said that “auditors … have a responsibility to consider
fraud and to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether
caused by fraud or error.”4 Other economic factors that could
result in enhanced SEC scrutiny include inflation and fluctuations
in foreign exchange rates.

The anticipated focus on disclosure in 2023 is also likely to be
affected by new rules that may be adopted by the SEC. Under
the leadership of Chair Gensler, the SEC has proposed a number
of rules that will, if adopted, expand disclosures in areas such
as cybersecurity and climate change. And the SEC is widely
expected to propose rules calling for added disclosure in several
areas, including human capital, emerging technologies, and
cryptocurrencies, among others.

In short, disclosure and financial reporting are likely to be priority
items on the 2023 agendas of many audit committees.

",,0
743,"Cost-of-living crisis

Ranked as the most severe global risk over the next
two years by GRPS respondents, a global Cost-ofliving crisis is already here, with inflationary pressures
disproportionately hitting those that can least afford
it. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, the price
of basic necessities – non-expendable items such
as food and housing – were on the rise.1 Costs
further increased in 2022, primarily due to continued
disruptions in the flows of energy and food from
Russia and Ukraine. To curb domestic prices, around
30 countries introduced restrictions, including export
bans, in food and energy last year, further driving
up global inflation.2 Despite the latest extension, the
looming threat of Russia pulling out of the Black Sea
Grain Export Deal has also led to significant volatility in
the price of essential commodities.

Although global supply chains have partly adapted,
with pressures significantly lower than the peak
experienced in April last year,3 price shocks to core
necessities have significantly outpaced general
inflation over this time (Figure 1.4). ",,0

745,"However, countries and territories are
locked in geopolitical competition, with the actors that previously facilitated
globalization now accelerating its contraction by prioritizing strategic
resilience and national security aims (see Bottom Line 1). This competition
is felt acutely in the advanced technology sector.

The proliferation of technology policy frameworks that bring like-minded
governments closer but, at the same time, deepen the geopolitical chasm
between industrialized democracies in the allied West and the “rest”:

The US-led Chip 4 alliance—a ""democratic semiconductor
supply chain""— has engaged Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan
in building shared semiconductor manufacturing links across
the region, based on trade and national security grounds.

The US-EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC) plans to
cooperate on the development and deployment of new
technologies based on shared democratic values, including
respect for human rights, that encourage compatible standards
and regulations, across the two members. The pact explicitly
mentions in its mandate, the importance of “building a shared
understanding of China's economic and industrial directives
and other non-market policies and practices.”

Western and Chinese tech firms are competing in Africa and
other emerging markets for technological influence.

geopolitical competition. ",,0

other generative AI into its processes. It could automate repetitive, low-creativity tasks with

organization. 26 ChatGPT could also be used to draft engagement reports or even to aid

departments with few in-house specialists in writing code for data analytics projects.

Similar to the business’s adoption cases, audit should be mindful about sharing

information with OpenAI as well as vetting the quality of the outputs.11 of 25

When deciding whether to adopt generative AI in their own workflows or when providing

assurance over use in the business, audit leaders can get some guidance from the newly

2023 Recommendations for Audit1. Rising Interest Rates

2. Currency Volatilty

Key Risk Indicators

• Rising interest rates have stymied economic growth and the financial well-being of

organizations, as central banks around the world adjust rates.

• Higher rates are necessary to counteract inflation, but by making borrowing more

expensive, they achieve their goal through a significant reduction of consumer

demand and business credit.

• Increase in interest rate of credit lines and loans

• Percentage of debt requiring short-term repayment

• Percentage of bad debts

• Fluctuations in the price of critical components

• As central banks target stronger currencies to tame inflation in their borders and

boost buying power abroad, increased currency risk has emerged as a threat to

company earnings and margins.

underpinned the Global Risks Report for nearly two
decades and is the World Economic Forum’s premier
source of original global risks data. This year’s
GRPS has brought together leading insights on the
evolving global risks landscape from over 1,200
experts across academia, business, government, the
international community and civil society. Responses
for the GRPS 2022-2023 were collected from 7
September to 5 October 2022.

Call to Action — Talent and Culture
BY FRAN MAXWELL

GLOBAL LEADER, WORKFORCE AND ORGANIZATIONAL TRANSFORMATION, PROTIVITI

People- and culture-related issues dominate the top 10

global risk issues for 2023, as do concerns related to the

economy. Many boards and executives, especially chief

human resources officers, understand that economic

headwinds can be a precursor to job cuts that, if overdone,

will create long-term challenges to managing human capital.

That is why the following steps should be emphasized over

the near term to sustain progress in transforming talent

management and preserving the culture:

• Make your talent your customer. The organization’s

focus on the customer experience should extend to its

own people and talent. Many companies can slice and

dice data to understand their customers, but fewer do

this with regard to the talent in their enterprise. ",,0

10 Water stress
This year, water stress will become a global and systemic challenge … while governments will
still treat it as a temporary crisis.

In 2022, receding water levels exacerbated the food crisis in Africa, halted shipping and nuclear output in Europe, and led
to factory shutdowns in China. Water scarcity also forced the United States to limit water releases in western states and
triggered social unrest in Latin America, heightening tensions between corporations and communities. Forecasts for 2023
are worse. ",,0
760,"Having failed
to adequately prepare for a permanent decrease in water availability, policymakers will rely on short-term emergency
measures that abruptly restrict and redistribute resources.
25 eurasia group  TOP RISKS 2023

US policymakers will have to choose between electricity
generation, water releases, industrial production, and food
production on the one hand, and water conservation on the
other. More US farmers, who will suffer the most from water
restrictions taking effect in 2023 (an up to 21% reduction
in Colorado River water supplies for some states), will be
asked to forgo harvesting to help tackle water scarcity.

Europe will face different challenges. Norway may have
to limit electricity exports to preserve hydropower for
domestic use, exposing itself to legal challenges from the
Netherlands and Germany. And sinking water levels in
the Rhine and Po rivers will disrupt inland shipping and
hamper broader economic activity in western Europe.

In Latin America, political decisions will push waterintensive industries such as beverage companies to
move facilities from dry to water-rich regions. Local
policymakers will follow Santiago de Chile’s lead by
rotating water cuts among customers, affecting the retail
and hospitality industries.

There are no quick fixes in sight. ",,1
761,"In this concluding section, we outline four principles
for preparedness in this new era of concurrent
shocks: 1) strengthening risk identification and
foresight, 2) recalibrating the present value of “future”
risks, 3) investing in multi-domain risk preparedness,
and 4) strengthening preparedness and response
cooperation.

Improving risk identification
and foresight

A wide range of disciplines aim to gather intelligence
about the future, ranging from economics, business
management, investment funds and insurance,
to urban planning, climatology, virology and civil
protection – but the track record around the use of
foresight to enhance risk mitigation efforts remains

mixed. The underestimation of – and therefore lack
of preparedness for – emerging macro risks (like
“grey rhinos” and “black swans”) reflect challenges
posed by high levels of uncertainty, low levels of
information, conflicting data and cognitive biases.
Yet systematic progress is possible. Enhanced risk
identification and foresight can be a key enabler
for strategic decision-making, agenda-setting and
resilience measures, helping to prioritize areas that
would benefit from data collection and monitoring,
risk controls and resources, and redundancies.

The first task of foresight is to identify future
developments, risks and opportunities. ",,0

Collective
Redress

Collective redress is defined as a “procedural mechanism which allows, for reasons of procedural economy

and/or efficiency of enforcement, many single claims (relating to the same case) to be bundled into a single

court action”. The development of collective redress mechanisms in Europe can create an inflation of claims

as seen with Class Actions in North America.

Critical
Infrastructure
Failures

In many regions of the world, there is a chronic failure to adequately invest in, upgrade and secure

infrastructure networks such as electricity provision, water supply, or transport infrastructure. The lack of

capacity or outages results in blackouts. This could lead to a higher than expected frequency and severity

of large property and non-property losses (incl. BI/CBI). ",,1

nuclear advances, and involvement in Ukraine will

West vs Rest strategic competition

Beyond its considerable humanitarian and economic
toll, the war in Ukraine has also increased divisions
between  the industrialized democracies of the West

often referred to as the global South. Russia has
weaponized its energy, raw materials, and food
exports in order to disrupt European unity and elicit
anti-Western sentiment in these developing
countries, many of whom declined to participate in
US-led sanctions against Russia. These middle and
emerging countries are becoming increasingly
important actors in global politics and are calling for
reforms of the current international order, which they
often perceive as  serving primarily Western

volatility, and elevated uncertainty will be endemic in Xi’s China. That’s a massive and underappreciated global challenge,
given the unprecedented reality of a state capitalist dictatorship having such an outsized role in the global economy.

Xi has committed a series of missteps in the recent past.

Last year we warned that China had walked itself into a zero-Covid trap; unfortunately, we were right. Xi’s refusal to offer
high-quality, foreign-made mRNA vaccines, combined with underwhelming vaccination drives even with locally made
doses, left the Chinese population more vulnerable to severe disease than it should be, and have made Xi’s sudden and
surprise exit from zero Covid much deadlier.

An opaque crackdown on private technology companies undercut global investor sentiment, put some of the country’s
most promising firms into a deep freeze, and wiped out an estimated one trillion dollars in market value.

And Xi’s announcement of a “no limits friendship” with Russia on 4 February 2022 lent credibility to Putin’s war in
Ukraine and darkened perceptions of China’s influence on the global system.

In each instance, Xi’s authoritarian personality and policy preferences—political control, economic statism, and

The United States and Europe will remain aligned in staunch support of Ukraine despite growing skepticism of
involvement in the US and internal disagreement in the EU over whether to press Ukraine to negotiate.

Regardless of fluctuations in political support in the United States in the coming months, Ukraine’s main benefactor has
already frontloaded its 2023 material assistance. The Biden administration ensured military and financial aid for the year
when it passed a $45 billion appropriation in December. In addition, lend-lease authority remains in place until the end

Industrial policies informed by national
security goals increase protectionism

Several countries are using industrial policies and
subsidies to accelerate the shift of supply chains away
from geopolitical rivals, as well as harsh investment
screening and export controls to keep critical
resources out of hostile hands. The result is a ramping
up of trade and investment barriers. The UN reports a
sharp increase in subsidies among G7 countries, from
0.6 percent of GDP in 2016, on average, to 2 percent
in 2020. ",,0

779,"Several demographic trends are changing the way that society functions. Among them is urban population growth with the development of

urban infrastructure, affecting how people move, work and socialize. Social cohesion is reducing in many countries due to the adoption of

societal values that put an emphasis on the individual. This trend has been boosted using digital media and services. Depending on the country,

demographic and consequently social make-up is changing. For example, increasingly ageing populations in many developed countries, a

rapidly increasing middle class in developing countries and mass-migrations of people both within and between countries fueled by a range

of economic, climate and geopolitical factors. Although uncontrolled migration could translate into increased pressure on welfare systems

and infrastructure, migration of skilled people is also crucial in the context of skills gaps created by retirement waves. These complex and

interconnected phenomena have a range of consequences, including the potential for widening wealth gaps, societal and geopolitical conflicts

and increasing environmental pressures.

Shifting
Geopolitical
Landscape

The recent period of Western-based liberalisation and globalisation is being challenged by a global trend towards polarization and more

assertive political policies. Renewed protectionism and anti-global sentiment have e.g. contributed to Brexit. ",,0
780,"Resource
and Supply
Management

All resources on which our life and global economy depend (incl. air, water, food and raw materials) can

suffer from scarcity if not managed sustainably throughout the entire product value chain. As the global

economy and the world population continue to grow - driven in large part by rapid medical advances,

industrialisation and growth in developing countries - the world’s needs for food, water and natural

resources also increase, putting pressure on limited resources. The increasing shortages and scarcities

impair life quality and spark geopolitical conflicts. On the other hand, the increasing demand for those

resources leads to exploring previously unexplored areas (e.g. drilling in the Arctic). Complex technologies

used in extreme environments lead to increased risks. For example, the development and extraction of

unconventional oil and gas deposits such as fracking, oil sands or undersea methane hydrates requires

procedures and technologies that differ significantly from those for conventional resources. With the

expansion of these techniques, concerns about environmental impact and sustainability are also increasing.

",,1
781,"Resistance to change has become a formidable obstacle to

success. Concerns with resistance to change represent the

fourth-rated risk overall for both 2023 and 2032, compared

to seventh and eighth for 2022 and 2031, respectively, in last

year’s survey. In the face of the disruption that lies ahead,

survey participants are concerned about their organizations’

agility to pivot in response to change — an incongruence that

can lead to strategic failure. In this era of rapid change, this

risk points to a need for trust, transparency and effective

strategic communications.

People and culture are once again at the top of the agenda.

Even amid an uncertain economy, inflationary conditions

and fears of a possible recession over the next 12 months,

people, talent and culture issues stand out as critical

concerns for the board and C-suite. Talented people and

culture are related, as the latter attracts the former and,

effectively led, the best and brightest engender innovative

cultures that can compete and win in the digital age. Several

important people and culture sub-themes emerged:

• Finding and keeping talent is THE top risk. ",,0

RISK FOCUS: METAVERSE

Beyond play:
As the metaverse evolves,
beware of new risks
Today’s connected world has opened new opportunities for businesses and individuals. The emergence of immersive
experiences, such as the metaverse, are taking connectivity to a new level. As technologies — including advances in
connectivity speeds, 3D reconstruction, artificial intelligence, and augmented or virtual reality — advance, the metaverse is
providing new ways to engage users, explore new places, and conduct business.

While more than half of our survey respondents said operations in the metaverse are not currently on their agenda (see
Figure 5), the global metaverse is growing steadily, with revenue projected to approach $800 billion by 2024.

",,0
787,"Social
bond issuances have already jumped sevenfold, to
$148 billion in 2022, targeting healthcare, education
and small and medium-sized enterprises.142 While
debt swaps may not create fiscal space beyond the
specific objective, SDG-linked conditionality may
enhance the willingness of creditors to consider debt
relief, particularly for countries where other forms of
fiscal support, including write-downs and conditional
grants, may be less likely.143

Finally, we are unlikely to be able to double down on
debt to the same extent to cushion the next crisis.
A more proactive approach to countries that are not
yet on the verge of debt distress could help mitigate
the systemic risk of sovereign debt contagion.
Recognition of simultaneous crises – debt, climate
impacts and food security – could be integrated
into greater flexibility and more concessional forms
of financing available to vulnerable markets. ",,0

Rethinking ‘future’ risks

Cognitive biases channel public attention towards
recent, “catastrophic” events. Business and
political imperatives tend to prioritize risks with
a direct, immediate and localized impact, such
as food, fuel or other commodities’ shortages or
local environmental disasters. This is necessary to

manage crises, especially when millions of lives and
livelihoods are at risk. However, when such risks
manifest, resources and attention are often diverted
from addressing global risks, especially those that
form the root causes of local catastrophes or those
that may arise outside the time frames relevant to
today’s leaders.

This can skew preparedness efforts in the public
2023   70
and private sector alike. For better planning and
preparedness, institutions must de-anchor risk
prioritization from shorter-term incentives. Despite
regularly featuring in the top rankings, the most
severe global risks – pertaining particularly to climate
and nature – are those we are still the least prepared
for. ",,1
789,"The “Urbanization and Social Change” is merged into the

“Technological Developments & Impacts on Society”

Some new risks have been also added to the radar beside the thorough review of

description of all risks in the radar:

—  Climate Engineering (incl. Carbon Capture Storage): Climate engineering, also

known as “geo-engineering” is the international large-scale intervention in the

Earth’s climate system to counter climate change. Currently, those techniques

can be divided into two categories: 1) Carbon dioxide removal techniques

(CDR) and 2) Solar geoengineering or “solar radiation management” (SRM)

—  Space Risk in Lower Earth Orbit: Lower Earth Orbit (LEO) is a critical space

resource on which many aspects of our current way of life depends. Global

communications systems - including satellite broadband coverage, Earth

observation systems including satellite imagery and weather forecasting, and

global positioning systems all rely on satellite infrastructure in LEO.

developing solutions for BI, supply disruption
and indeed many of the other risks in this year’s
Allianz Risk Barometer. Access to good quality
structured data will help the insurance industry
to be more creative and develop new solutions
and products, aligning these with the pain
points of customers, which continually change
over time.

Companies need to constantly review
business continuity planning across the whole
organization, not only at headquarter level, but
down to the various subsidiaries and sites.

“Business interruption risk is not typically fixed
on a particular trigger, location or product, it can
originate from various areas and cross sites and
continents. As such you need holistic measures,”
advises Pachov.

Following the disruption caused by the
pandemic, and more recently the war in Ukraine,
many organizations are looking to better
understand their supply chain and BI exposures,
improving transparency, identifying critical
suppliers and understanding pinch points.
Intensifying supplier selection, monitoring,
auditing and risk assessment is the fourth most
common de-risking action (39%).

791,"China is increasingly flexing

its economic and political clout and the general shift of global economic power from the West to the East is increasing the complexity and

instability of global power balances. Conflict escalation becomes more likely. This has recently been demonstrated by Russia’s invasion of

Ukraine. Heightened conflict risk is also visible in many other areas of the World, i.e. the Korean peninsula, South China Sea and Middle East

tensions. Escalation into military conflict of global proportion and even use of nuclear weapons seems possible.

Antimicrobial
Resistance

Drug resistance occurs when microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites change in ways

that render certain medications ineffective. When microorganisms become resistant to most antimicrobials

they are often referred to as “superbugs”. This is a major concern because a resistant infection may cause

significant medical and financial costs.

Artificial
Intelligence

With progress in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and cognitive computing, machines may begin to make decision

on behalf of humans. Decision transfer and lack of transparency or human oversight may result in unforeseen

risks or unpredictable outcomes creating complex liability issues. ",,0

are affecting companies’ strategies:

While it is uncertain how the Russian invasion of
Ukraine will impact the global telecom industry
in the long run, the list of potential risks
(security and reputational concerns) is already
expanding for companies operating in Russia and
causing changes to their international operations.
Foreign firms that decide to exit the Russian
market are expected to experience less material
losses, as the Russian telecom industry is highly
localised, with operators being domestically
owned or having minimal input from
international stakeholders.
The situation is different for companies opting to
continue operating in Russia despite global
sanctions and corporate boycotts. They incur
risks of being subject to secondary sanctions or
losing access to the global market, as
collaboration with Russia is no longer tolerated.

Human factors are also limiting progress: EY research12 shows that the negative
impact of remote working on collaboration is viewed as the top cultural challenge
facing telcos’ transformation agendas. While many telcos were encouraged by the
tactical transformation they executed during the early stages of the pandemic, it
now seems that the rapid shift toward remote working risks compounding functional
silos. Cultural differences between geographies ranks as the second biggest barrier,
underlining the relatively greater challenge faced by multi-market operators.

Increasing levels of efficiency and agility are critical for
telcos, especially given current inflationary pressures.

The issue is compounded by surging demand: incumbent operators in some
countries have been reporting new internet usage records, such as in the UK in
December 2021. And global data usage continues to rise exponentially, with new
digital concepts such as the metaverse adding to concerns that networks will come
under additional strain in the medium term. The prospect of energy rationing also
means that infrastructure power supply cannot be taken for granted.

Key Risk Indicators

• With weather-related natural disasters increasing 83% over the last 20 years, the

effect of extreme weather events such as heatwaves, floods, droughts, storms and

wildfires has become a continuously escalating threat for organizations.

• More frequent extreme weather has a significant effect on the workforce, with a

conservative estimate of productivity lost by 2030, globally, showing 2.2% of

working hours lost (the equivalent of 80 million jobs).

• Supply chain effectiveness is also increasingly aggravated by extreme weather,

with 72% of heads of supply chain reporting that environmental events affect their

ability to fulfill supply chain strategies.

• Percentage of working hours lost due to climate-related incidents

• Number of incidents of extreme weather in the regions of operations

• Frequency of extreme weather events in locations of critical third parties

• Sixty to eighty percent of climate change adaptation costs — the cost of reducing

the negative impacts of climate change — are attributed to critical infrastructure left

exposed from more frequent climate events.

Areas of risk oversight in 2023
For many, the number and severity of risks seem to increase daily,
suggesting that in 2023 the audit committee will increasingly need to
focus on its risk oversight responsibilities. A complete list of the risks
to be overseen in 2023 might be very lengthy, but a survey reported
in the Audit Committee Practices Report suggests that the following
areas are most likely to be the subjects of audit committee risk
oversight in 2023: disclosure, including financial reporting, internal
controls, and fraud; cybersecurity; effectiveness of the enterprise
risk management program; environmental, social, and governance
(ESG) reporting and disclosure; inflation; and digital transformation.
We address some of these, as well as other risks, below.

802,"Below are key findings of the report.

Cost of living dominates global
risks in the next two years while
climate action failure dominates
the next decade

The next decade will be characterized by
environmental and societal crises, driven by
underlying geopolitical and economic trends. “Costof-living crisis” is ranked as the most severe global
risk over the next two years, peaking in the short
term. “Biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse”
is viewed as one of the fastest deteriorating global
risks over the next decade, and all six environmental
risks feature in the top 10 risks over the next 10
years. Nine risks are featured in the top 10 rankings
over both the short and the long term, including
“Geoeconomic confrontation” and “Erosion
of social cohesion and societal polarisation”,
alongside two new entrants to the top rankings:
“Widespread cybercrime and cyber insecurity”
and “Large-scale involuntary migration”.

As an economic era ends, the
next will bring more risks of
stagnation, divergence and
distress

The economic aftereffects of COVID-19 and the war
in Ukraine have ushered in skyrocketing inflation, a
rapid normalization of monetary policies and started
a low-growth, low-investment era.

806,"Intensive and inefficient farming has
exacerbated soil degradation, water stress, pollution
and the decline in production capacity. This has
created broader domestic trade-offs, particularly with
sectors directly dependent on biological resources,
with knock-on impacts for economic growth and
productivity and the speed of the green transition.
Arable land has been increasingly prioritized for
agriculture, shifting away from biofuels and green
energy infrastructure.

Similar to Resource constraints, water stress
is now widespread. In developing countries, this
particularly impacts women and girls responsible
for water collection, with knock-on impacts for
health and education outcomes. More widespread
scarcity, combined with paralysis of international
cooperation mechanisms, has necessitated a degree
of water nationalism, resulting in prolonged disputes
between neighbouring countries.34 In the face of
spreading humanitarian crises and state instability,
water infrastructure continues to be used both as
a weapon and target, mirroring past water conflicts
and terrorism in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan.35 In
addition, there is less visible abuse and depletion of
shared “non-renewable” groundwater reserves, such
as in Saharan Africa and the Middle East, raising the
risk of conflict.36

Conditions of scarcity initially consolidated the
influence of geopolitical blocs, heavily reflecting raw
resource trade dependences, as well as innovation

view on how the culture has developed.

This divergence of opinion pivots on contrasting views of remote working.
An overwhelming 91% of Technology, Media & Entertainment and
Telecommunications (TMT) employees want to work remotely for two or more
days a week, but 25% of TMT employers believe everyone should return five days

technology strategies. While 85% of TMT organizations say they will need to

the organization’s resilience and agility to navigate

an unexpected crisis that might significantly impact

its operations and reputation. Because uncertainties

abound, most are realizing that it is not a matter of if the

organization will face a crisis, but rather it is a matter of

when a crisis might occur. Preparing today for tomorrow’s

crisis makes good business sense.

Majority view most top 10 risks as
significant

Table 2 reveals the overall percentage of respondents who

scored each of the top 10 risks as “Significant Impact” risks

(6.0 or higher), as well as the percentage of respondents

who rate each as a 5.0 (Medium) or as 4.0 or below (Low)

for 2023. This provides another perspective on the view of

the top risk issues globally, distinct from individual scores.

The perception that the overall risk environment for 2023

continues to be significant (an average of 6.7 on a 10-point

scale) is supported by the fact that the majority of board

members and executives rate all of the top 10 risks at the

“Significant Impact” level. This suggests that these top risks

have the potential to noticeably impact most organizations

in the coming year.

Legal &
Regulatory
Uncertainty

Current regulatory trends have prompted companies to re-examine the effectiveness of their governance

and oversight. The continued adoption of new or proposed regulations, capital standards or accounting

changes (e.g. IFRS17) can lead to compliance challenges and to increasing regulatory complexity. Conduct

regulation continues to gain prominence and is one key example of where this risk can emerge. Furthermore,

‘non-regulation’ has also been identified as a risk in some areas.

Medical
Advances

Significant advances have been made recently in several medical specialties that can bring potential benefits

in prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illnesses and thus can improve health and longevity. However,

information asymmetry between insurer and applicant may arise, with impacts on availability, pricing and

claims. At the same time, these advances could increase the cost of some insurance products, such as

health covers, and present new opportunities for other products such as life insurance covers. ",,1
816,"For example, data centres of different institutions
in differing geographies are highly unlikely to be
exposed to the same cyber or extreme weather
risks, meaning effective mitigation could include
regular backups of each other’s systems.10

Re-building and strengthening
global risk preparedness
cooperation

While national risk preparedness can enhance the
ability of societies and economies to rebound from
shocks, most global risks are ‘owned’ by no one
and sit outside the direct control of any one public
or private sector entity – meaning many global risks
are most effectively tackled through coordinated,
global action. Respondents to the GRPS shared their
views on which stakeholders were best prepared
to tackle the key risks covered in the survey (Figure
4.1). The majority consider national governments,
multi-country efforts and international organizations
to be the most relevant stakeholders for governing
these global risks – recognizing that global risks are
complex, and effective preparedness can require
action at local, national, regional and global levels.

International cooperation has reached levels that
may have been unimaginable even a century ago.
However, the recent overload of crises has turned the
focus of nations inwards and the emerging outlook
for international cooperation is deteriorating. ",,0
817,"Higher oil prices will also increase frictions between
OPEC+, led by Saudi Arabia, and global consumers, led by
the United States, as both sides pursue conflicting fiscal
objectives. OPEC+ wants to protect a price floor of about
$90 per barrel for Brent (some in the West think $100),
much higher than before the Ukraine war and at odds
with consumer preferences. This divergence will increase
conflict between the US and its Gulf allies with rising
grievances already driven by Washington’s pivot to Asia, its
transition to non-hydrocarbon energy, its focus on domestic
production, and the Gulf’s growing energy and security
ties with China. Not to mention the Biden administration’s
focus on human rights and “democracy vs. autocracy,” as
well as its move to build an oil consumer cartel of sorts.
Higher prices will prompt the US to intervene directly in
markets and punish moves by oil-producing states it sees as
(at least partially) politically motivated.

Regarding gas, high prices and supply limits will require
more financial support from already stretched European
governments, fueling calls for more EU-wide borrowing
to help member states shoulder the burden. ",,0
818,"10 Overall, organizations are less pressured to make

concessions on in-office requirements to attract talent.

Despite a modest loosening of conditions, the environment remains competitive overall,

given the low levels of unemployment and reduced labor force participation since the start

of the pandemic. 11 Conflicting economic signals in the short to medium term make

workforce strategy decisions particularly difficult. 12 Risks of overshooting with layoff

targets could have long-term repercussions, as the threat of persistently competitive talent

markets would limit opportunities to rehire.

Driver 2: Evolving Regulatory Landscape5 of 25

Talent scarcity is not the only driver affecting employee leverage. In the U.S., several

states have introduced new pay transparency requirements for job postings, which went

into effect on 1 January 2023. 13 The European Union has embraced similar transparency

rules, which will soon go into effect. 14 These requirements add a new variable to retention

and recruitment, with the potential to increase employee leverage in securing higher

salaries or accelerate movements to other organizations.

Early reporting has highlighted extremely broad salary ranges, such as a software

engineering position at Netflix that could earn between $90,000 and $900,000. ",,0

In a continuously changing world full of uncertainties, Chief Audit Executives and Internal
Audit functions must remain agile when establishing their risk landscape and developing
their 2023 audit plan.

In a post COVID-19 world, where organizations are still facing several challenges (e.g.,
supply chain issues, changing workforce mindset, etc.), the last few months have shown
that we should always be on the lookout for new threats and challenges. The skyrocketing
inflation as well as geopolitical issues will be impacting many organizations.

These new developments are accompanied by emerging risks that the Internal Audit
function should take into consideration in its risk assessment and (dynamic) annual
plan, without neglecting the key established risks. As a result, we present you our
recommended key areas for focus for FY23.

",,0
820,"Governments and central banks could face stubborn
inflationary pressures over the next two years, not
least given the potential for a prolonged war in
Ukraine, continued bottlenecks from a lingering
pandemic, and economic warfare spurring supply
chain decoupling. Downside risks to the economic
outlook also loom large. A miscalibration between
monetary and fiscal policies will raise the likelihood
of liquidity shocks, signaling a more prolonged
economic downturn and debt distress on a global
scale. Continued supply-driven inflation could lead
to stagflation, the socioeconomic consequences
of which could be severe, given an unprecedented
interaction with historically high levels of public
debt. Global economic fragmentation, geopolitical
tensions and rockier restructuring could contribute to
widespread debt distress in the next 10 years.

Even if some economies experience a softer-thanexpected economic landing, the end of the low
interest rate era will have significant ramifications
for governments, businesses and individuals. The
knock-on effects will be felt most acutely by the
most vulnerable parts of society and already-fragile
states, contributing to rising poverty, hunger, violent
protests, political instability and even state collapse.

The highest number of European countries involved so far.

The survey elicited a record-breaking 834 responses from CAEs across Europe. Simultaneously, four
roundtable discussions were organised with 39 CAEs on each of the risk areas covered in the report.
In addition, we also conducted 9 one-to-one interviews with subject matter experts that included
CAEs, Audit Committee Chairs and industry experts to provide deeper insights into how these risks are
manifesting and developing.

824,"“The conflict in Ukraine and wider
geopolitical tensions are reshaping the cyber risk
landscape, heightening the risk of a large-scale cyberattack, according to respondents. The frequency of
ransomware attacks remains high, with losses increasing
as criminals hone their tactics to extort more money, while
the average cost of a data-breach is at an all-time high.
At the same time, attacks are not just restricted to large
companies, increasingly we see more small and midsize businesses impacted. Then, there is also a growing
shortage of cyber security professionals, which brings
challenges when it comes to improving security.“

Given cyber crime incidents are now estimated to cost
the world economy in excess of $1trn a year1 – around 1%
of global GDP – it perhaps should come as no surprise
that cyber risk is the top customer concern in this year’s
Allianz Risk Barometer, selected by more than a third of
all respondents.

In addition to being voted the top risk globally, cyber
incidents also ranks as the top peril in 19 different
countries. ",1.0,0
825,"We used a 10-point scale, whereby 1 signifies “Extremely

Unlikely to Make Changes” and 10 signifies “Extremely

Likely to Make Changes.”

Consistent with the marked increase in the perception of the

risk environment, respondents indicate a higher likelihood

of deploying more resources to risk management in 2023

relative to 2022 (and 2021), as reflected by Figure 42.

Given the confluence of multiple, complex and interrelated

risks, as reported above, we are not surprised by this result.

There continues to be a need to invest in more robust risk

management capabilities, especially in light of the past three

years of pandemic-related risk concerns. The pandemic expe
rience has highlighted the need for preparedness and agility

as well as demonstrated that companies can innovate within

a fraction of pre-pandemic project timelines. Furthermore, as

it unfolded it may have shifted the focus away from improving

risk management infrastructure, especially in those industries

where surviving the crisis was the primary focus.

A further major impact from inflation is higher operating costs, with telcos’ energy and wage costs in focus.
Rising energy prices have prompted telcos to disclose their energy costs and hedging exposure. In general,
expenditure on energy equates to up to 3% of European telcos’ earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization, with up to half of this exposed to price inflation. The impact of wage inflation is a further
risk, with wages being equivalent to about 16% of revenues.

At the same time, infrastructure costs are increasingly sensitive to inflation due to the rising prevalence of
sale-and-leaseback tower outsourcing. However, the impact on equipment costs is more difficult to quantify
— and companies are not yet voicing concerns about this. That said, fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) rollouts are
inherently labor-intensive and a potential source of vulnerability in the current environment.

Methodology

The GRPS 2022–2023 was further refined this year
to gather more granular perceptions of risk and to
incorporate new approaches to risk management
and analysis. The GRPS 2022–2023 was comprised
of six sections:

1. Outlook for the World asked respondents to
characterize their outlook for the world over
the short term (two years) and the long term
(10 years). Respondents were provided with
five options: (1) Progressive tipping points
and persistent crises leading to catastrophic
outcomes, (2) Consistently volatile across
economies and industries with multiple shocks
accentuating divergent trajectories, (3) Slightly
volatile with occasional localized surprises,
(4) Limited volatility with relative stability, and
(5) Renewed stability with a revival of global
resilience. A simple tally for each of the five
options was calculated. ",,1
830,"As geopolitics trumps economics,
a longer-term rise in inefficient production and rising
prices becomes more likely. Geographic hotspots
that are critical to the effective functioning of the
global financial and economic system, in particular in
the Asia-Pacific, also pose a growing concern.
2023   7
Interstate confrontations are anticipated by GRPS
respondents to remain largely economic in nature
over the next 10 years. However, the recent uptick
in military expenditure and proliferation of new
technologies to a wider range of actors could
drive a global arms race in emerging technologies.
The longer-term global risks landscape could be
defined by multi-domain conflicts and asymmetric
warfare, with the targeted deployment of new-tech
weaponry on a potentially more destructive scale
than seen in recent decades. Transnational arms
control mechanisms must quickly adapt to this new
security context, to strengthen the shared moral,
reputational and political costs that act as a deterrent
to accidental and intentional escalation.

Technology will exacerbate
inequalities while risks from
cybersecurity will remain a
constant concern

The technology sector will be among the central
targets of stronger industrial policies and enhanced
state intervention. ",,0

834,"This responsibility
stems from a number of legal requirements; for example, the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules require
disclosure as to whether the audit committee recommends to the
full board the inclusion of a company’s financial statements in its
annual report on Form 10-K. Another example is the SarbanesOxley Act and related SEC rules, which give the audit committee
sole responsibility for hiring, monitoring, compensating, and
(where appropriate) firing the independent auditors. The audit
committee also has oversight responsibility for the internal audit
function. Flowing from these requirements and practices, the
audit committee is the repository of the most knowledge of and
familiarity with disclosure requirements, including concepts such
as materiality.

These and other areas relating to disclosure are likely to be in the
spotlight in 2023, in part because of ongoing enforcement efforts
by the SEC and other government agencies, investor and media
scrutiny, and other factors, including historical evidence that
recessionary economies and market volatility tend to increase

decision to delay the release of long-scheduled economic
data during the 20th Party Congress was an ominous sign

heightened market and company sensitivity to the singular

he conveys, resulting in a repricing of credit risks that in
turn drives debt defaults and bankruptcies. Beijing will
struggle to manage these pressures in an environment of
centralized power and stifled debate.

A final risk area is foreign policy, where Xi’s nationalist views
and assertive style will drive Beijing’s relations with the
world. Xi isn’t looking for a near-term crisis, given the scale
and immediacy of economic challenges at home. But “wolf
warrior” diplomacy will nonetheless intensify as diplomats
channel Xi’s bold rhetoric, often at the expense of effective

Cyber business interruption

Cyber BI exposures are also growing with the
trend for digitalization, as companies introduce
new technology, as well as live with the legacy
of aging IT infrastructure and software.

Fast-pace technology transformation can
introduce new risks to business models
without appropriate protections, says
Marianna Grammatika, a Regional Head of
Risk Consulting at AGCS: “Digital risks are
intangible, often not well understood and can be
difficult to quantify. ",1.0,0
841,"Crises now systemic
“It is more than three years now since we
have been in a state of emergency, including
most recently from the situation in Ukraine,
and we can see that these crises are
becoming systemic,” Stanislas Martin, chief
risk officer at the French energy company EDF
who is responsible for crisis management at
the business, says.

Every sector has its own story. As well as
the pandemic, a storm-induced, winter
energy outage in Texas in 2021 triggered

concerns in the industry that exceptional
worsening weather conditions could lead to
more frequent shutdowns elsewhere in the
world. Energy systems are generally designed
to withstand peaks in demand during cold
snaps - but not if they happen in all parts
of the system (or across inter-connected
countries) at the same time. It sparked
a global rush in energy businesses to
understand which lessons could be learnt
from the Texas storm and to ensure that they
could manage such risks in future. Then,
from September 2021 – and set to continue
into 2023 – energy shortages started to send
prices high, a situation that has spiralled into
a full-blown global crisis because Russia is a
key supplier of gas in Europe.

842,"Nor does it mean that Washington
won’t keep pushing hardline policies in this area (including more targeted regulations and export controls) under the
banner of national security—it will. But the White House knows it needs to draw a line under deteriorating relations
with Beijing. This means refraining from embarrassing or provoking China unnecessarily, focusing instead on
stabilizing the relationship overall and working more constructively in areas of mutual interest.
We try not to think too hard about writing a report on where the world is
going (put it that way, and it feels like a daunting task). But it’s not about
prediction. You start with where the world is, really is, and to the extent
that you get that assessment right, it constrains more outcomes than any
crystal ball ever could. In many ways, Top Risks is about the art of what’s
not possible.

We learn as much about ourselves as the world in the process. What
biases are we holding on to that need to be challenged? What are the
things we think we know that aren’t really so? And what would make us
wrong?

We hope we’ve addressed these issues—we’ve certainly tried! ",,0
843,"Figures 28-35 highlight the top five risks from each of

the eight geographic regions we examine and include

the risk scores for 2023 and, separately, for 2032, as

well as, where available, scores for those risks reported

in our 2022 and 2021 reports. There are noticeable

differences in views about risks around the globe, which

is especially important for multinational organizations

to consider. Seventeen of the 38 risks appear among the

eight geographic regions as top five risks and nine of the

12 macroeconomic risks are recognized in the top five

risks when looking across the different geographies, with

Latin America reporting all five of their top risk concerns

as macroeconomic in nature. As noted above, respondents

from Australia/New Zealand, India, the Middle East and

Africa rate all five of their top five risks at the “Significant

Impact” level. Organizations in the Australia/New Zealand

region rate three of their top five risks higher than 6.5 and

respondents from Africa identify four risks at the 6.5 level

or higher, indicating elevated levels of concern relative

to other regions. Respondents from North America, Latin

America, Europe and Asia report zero risks at this level.

844,"How the global order
resettles after the conflict in Ukraine could bring about
an even more unstable world, with increasing divides
between major economies. In that world, new
disruptions that interrupt business operations in a
similar way are even more likely – and potentially
more damaging. Part of the lift for ESG strategists and
boards will be to closely track geopolitical shifts and
identify new crises as we see the end of the
European “peace dividend.""There will be fundamental differences between global
companies with more public ESG duties and local
companies with more limited ESG expectations. Even
today, the pressures weighing on high-profile global
operations are not felt equally by smaller businesses,
particularly those operating in markets without high
ESG accountability. Also, the perceptions and
demands of ESG in different regions vary.
Encouraging global corporates to accept this
differentiated responsibility will be a central
determinant for the future of ESG. The ensuing social
issues and humanitarian responses, coupled with
additional emerging concerns including biodiversity
loss, and human rights abuses, create an overlapping

Unintended Consequences of Incorporation Into Business Processes

Apart from decentralized usage, organizations may deliberately choose to adopt ChatGPT

or similar generative AI technologies into their business processes to take advantage of

efficiency gains from the technology. ChatGPT is just one example of external AI, where

organizations either use external data sources or third-party solutions, rather than develop

and train models internally. Adoption of these tools is likely to expand over time and will

pose significant challenges for auditing. Audit will be limited in how far it can assess data

quality where large volumes of external data have been used to train the model.

ChatGPT’s outputs also do not include information about sources, making it difficult to

trace and verify information. Like many AI models, the actual process the bot uses to

generate output is opaque, a “black box” where only inputs and outputs are visible. Audit

therefore hits a wall in providing assurance over what the model is doing when it

generates content.

",,0
846,"According to the latest Audit Committee Practices Report published
by Deloitte and the Center for Audit Quality, 43% of the total
respondents surveyed said that the audit committee has primary
oversight responsibility for enterprise risk management.

However, the audit committee’s responsibility for risk oversight
goes beyond understanding and advising with regard to the
creation and implementation of a sound enterprise risk program.
The committee is charged with understanding and advising on
how management continuously identifies, monitors, and assesses
risks and ensuring that material risks are allocated to the full
board or the appropriate committee. And the audit committee
is itself responsible for overseeing key areas of risk, such as risks
that impact financial reporting and disclosure, including internal
controls and fraud.

1. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 mandated the formation of risk committees at certain large financial institutions. However, risk committees have not become
prevalent in other companies. According to the 2022 U.S. Spencer Stuart Board Index, only 12% of the S&P 500 had such committees.

SURVEY METHODOLOGY

4

A comprehensive list of 46 risk factors was collected and analysed. The risks were grouped into two
main categories: macroeconomic and industry-specific risks. The approach enables a detailed
assessment of risk factors based on their relevance to companies in the telecom industry.

Macroeconomic risks — risk factors relevant to
businesses across industries during the normal
course of business. Also referred to as market
risks or general risks.

Industry-specific risks — risk factors that
primarily or solely relate to the telecom
industry or are especially significant to
companies in this industry.

848,"There is growing concern about the consequences of unchecked emissions of greenhouse gases driving climate change, with

the more frequent occurrence of extreme weather events. The pressure placed on the planet from a growing human population is causing

resource scarcity, driven by unsustainable practices in mineral extraction, food and energy production. Anthropogenic activities are also

polluting the land, rivers and sea with non-biodegradable waste such as plastics, and the air with particulate and gaseous pollutants. All forms

of pollution are becoming ubiquitous, with harmful consequences for life on Earth including decline in biodiversity, with the potential to disrupt

entire ecosystems.

As well as responding to environmental challenges, the ESG agenda requires consideration of human rights violations, bribery, corruption, social

divides and unethical corporate behaviour. How organisations respond to these factors is coming under increasing scrutiny from stakeholders

such as investors, regulators and consumers, with the expectation that companies both manage the risks they are directly exposed to, as well

as contributing to broader sustainable economic and social development goals. There is also an expectation that organisations engage wider

societal groups in their stakeholder management. A failure to adequately respond can adversely impact brand and reputation. ",,1

Global risks Description

Asset bubble bursts Prices for housing, investment funds, shares and other assets become increasingly disconnected from the

real economy, leading to a severe drop in demand and prices. Includes, but is not limited to: cryptocurrencies,

energy prices, housing prices, and stock markets.

Collapse of a systemically important
industry or supply chain

Collapse of a systemically important global industry or supply chain with an impact on the global economy,

financial markets or society leading to an abrupt shock to the supply and demand of systemically important

goods and services at a global scale. Includes, but is not limited to: energy, food and fast-moving consumer

goods.

Debt crises Corporate or public finances struggle to service debt accumulation, resulting in mass bankruptcies or

insolvencies, liquidity crises or defaults and sovereign debt crises.

Failure to stabilize price trajectories Inability to control the general price level of goods and services, including commodities. Inclusive of an

unmanageable increase (inflation) or decrease (deflation) of prices.

reputationally, legally and more.

Further complicating things, is the ability to co-opt
advanced technology for nefarious use with equal

Invest in a cybersecurity strategy

Enhance cybersecurity risk quantification.
According to the most recent Cyber Trust Insights survey, only 58
percent of companies describe their approach to quantifying cyber
risks as ’robust’ and that their cyber risk scenarios are adequately
tailored to meet business needs. To address this, careful modelling
and quantification work can help decision-makers understand the
organization’s true level of cyber risk exposure. This can help
management understand which controls contribute most to
reducing certain cyber exposures — and, therefore, helps ensure
they are focusing their resources in the areas of greatest return.

Foreword
After more than a decade of strong growth, the technology industry is going through a reset, triggered mainly by
shifting economic realities.

Global economies are slowing, and access to capital is pausing as investors assess the economic landscape.
Supply chain issues are affecting hardware sales, and tech companies are announcing layoffs at levels not seen
in 20 years.

Our Global Technology Industry Risk Study 2023 shows how economic uncertainty is affecting risk management at
technology companies as they focus on resetting priorities to respond to existing and emerging risks.

To understand technology companies’ responses to global economic uncertainty, we surveyed over 300 risk
management leaders from 29 countries across six continents. We thank all of our respondents for taking the
time to answer our questions.

We hope this year’s study helps you better understand how your peers view the changing risks affecting the
technology industry, and provides guidance on how to better manage those risks going forward. ",,0
854,"Exponentially accelerating nature
loss and climate change

Nature loss and climate change are intrinsically
interlinked – a failure in one sphere will cascade
into the other, and attaining net zero will require
mitigatory measures for both levers.2 If we are
unable to limit warming to 1.5°C or even 2°C, the
continued impact of natural disasters, temperature
and precipitation changes will become the dominant
cause of biodiversity loss, in terms of composition
and function (Figure 2.4).3 Heatwaves and droughts
are already causing mass mortality events (a single
hot day in 2014 killed more than 45,000 flying foxes
in Australia), while sea level rises and heavy storms
have caused the first extinctions of entire species.4
Arctic sea-ice, warm-water coral reefs and terrestrial
ecosystems have been found most at risk in the
near term, followed by forest, kelp and seagrass
ecosystems.5

The impacts of climate change on ecosystems can
further constrain their mitigation effects. ",,1

lead time required for expanding class sizes of nursing

programs and the current shortage of nursing instructors,

the supply of nurses is unlikely to grow meaningfully in the

short term.

Compounding the impact of traditional labor costs (i.e.,

wages, benefits and payroll tax), many employers in the

healthcare industry are now offering expanded benefits,

including tuition reimbursement, flexible work options

and a variety of caregiver benefits.17 Many providers also

are offering access to mental health services along with

modified or new employee assistance programs. Although

these are strong tools for recruitment and retention, they

all result in increased labor cost.

The pandemic and government policies surrounding public

health practices continue to have an impact

According to the WHO, adequately addressing the

shrinking labor force will be a significant policy concern for

health authorities and governments around the world in

the coming years. The most common cause of disruptions

to health services in a majority of the WHO member states

will be a lack of available health workers.18

top 10 risks as “Significant Impact” risks and even though

respondents perceive the overall risk environment to be at

its highest level in 11 years, only one of the 38 risks is, on

average, at the “Significant Impact” level when combining

the rankings of all respondents for each risk. This is relatively

consistent with the past two years, where none in 2022 and

only one in 2021 were rated at that level, even during the

COVID-19 pandemic. The other 37 risk issues fall into the

category of “Potential Impact” risks. None of the risks are

rated at the lowest level (“Less Significant Impact”) for 2023,

which is consistent with last year, while only one risk was

at that level two years earlier. This suggests that all of the

concerns to be considered by board members and executives.

Productivity, efficiency, and ESG: A
strategy for troubled economic times
Both Eurasia Group’s report and the DRA (page 1) show a self-evident yet critical bottom line:
the current “polycrisis” and the ensuing geopolitical recession are deteriorating economic
conditions, mainly through historically high inflation and unravelling years of global
advancements. The IMF highlights that the cost-of-living crisis, tightening financial conditions in
most regions, the Russian government’s invasion of Ukraine, and the lingering COVID-19
pandemic all weigh heavily on the global economic outlook. Global growth is projected to fall
from an estimated 3.4 percent in 2022 to 2.9 percent in 2023, then rise to 3.1 percent in 2024.
The forecast for 2023 is 0.2 percentage point higher than predicted in the October 2022 World
Economic Outlook (WEO) but below the historical (2000–19) average of 3.8 percent. From a
business lens, our CEO Outlook shows that 86 percent of leaders believe we are entering a
recession over the next 12 months. As a silver lining, the data on resilience hints at some

will face substantial water risks to their operations or supply chains.

Within countries, the number of water-related conflicts, already up sharply since the 1980s, will reach new heights in 2023.
The impact will be greatest in the Middle East and Africa, where water will act as a “trigger” in places where militias
fight over the scarce resource, and as a “casualty” in places where militants destroy water pumps, tanks, and pipes. Water
scarcity will also trigger refugee flows in the Middle East (Syria, Iraq, and Yemen), threaten economic prospects in North
Africa (Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia), and heighten food insecurity in the horn of Africa (Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia) by
driving food prices higher and forcing farmers to migrate. The spillover effects on domestic inequality will increase social
unrest in those places where they combine with other economic and social crises, including high inflation, unemployment,
disease outbreaks, and energy shortages.

While the consequences of water stress will worsen, governments’ ability to handle them will not improve. ",,1

For the first time since 1950, the world’s population is
set to decline over the next few decades. This creates
another challenge to the globalization model — and its
prosperity — as it relies on a growing population to
continuously invest and drive growth. As the baby
boomers retire this decade, many populations may not
have sufficient Gen X and millennials to replace them
without triggering labor shortages. ",,0
874,"Last year, however,
most people (39%) cited mental health as
their main reason for choosing this risk, likely
motivated by the persistence of lockdowns as
a policy response to the pandemic. This year,
mental health (27%) has fallen well behind
over-dependence on medication (45%) as the
top concern within the category.

Among experts, by contrast, concern about
mental health remained the overriding reason
for choosing this risk, cited by 57% last year
and 54% this year.

AXA Research Fund supported scientist
Dr. Jasmin Wertz points to several promising
solutions: teletherapy and online counselling;
integrating mental healthcare in primary care
settings; and innovative efforts to train
physicians to combine expertise in physical
and mental healthcare, putting the patient
at the centre.

Covid-19 and its impacts are a key factor
in AXA’s Mind Health Study, which finds that
in almost every country mental wellbeing
is second only to the economy as the biggest
casualty of the pandemic(5).

Our respondent group of 1,304 executives, comprised

primarily of board members and C-suite executives from

all major regions of the world, provided their perspectives

about the potential impact in 2023, and also in 2032, of 38

specific risks across three dimensions.1

• Macroeconomic risks likely to affect their organization’s

growth opportunities

• Strategic risks the organization faces that may affect the

validity of its strategy for pursuing growth opportunities

• Operational risks that might affect key operations of the

organization in executing its strategy

In presenting the results of our research, we begin with

a brief description of our methodology and an executive

summary of the high-level results. Following that overview,

we highlight several calls for action that executives may

want to consider as they evaluate the effectiveness of

their organization’s risk governance processes in light of

the key findings. Then, we discuss the overall risk concerns

for 2023, including how they have changed from the two

most recent surveys conducted for 2022 and 2021. We

also provide a discussion of the top risk concerns for 2032

(and changes from our survey last year about 2031 top

Key highlights from this study

Major themes for 2023 and 2032

• Uncertainty abounds, triggering heightened

risk concerns for executives and boards. Survey

respondents rate the overall severity and magnitude

of risks at the highest level we have observed in the 11

years this study has been conducted.

",,0
878,"Associated social unrest and political instability will
not be contained to emerging markets, as economic
pressures continue to hollow out the middle-income
bracket. Mounting citizen frustration at losses in
human development and declining social mobility,
together with a widening gap in values and equality,
are posing an existential challenge to political systems
around the world. The election of less centrist leaders
as well as political polarization between economic
superpowers over the next two years may also reduce
space further for collective problem-solving, fracturing
alliances and leading to a more volatile dynamic.

With a crunch in public-sector funding and competing
security concerns, our capacity to absorb the next

global shock is shrinking. Over the next 10 years,
fewer countries will have the fiscal headroom to invest
in future growth, green technologies, education,
care and health systems. The slow decay of public
infrastructure and services in both developing and
advanced markets may be relatively subtle, but
accumulating impacts will be highly corrosive to the
strength of human capital and development – a critical
mitigant to other global risks faced.

",,0
879,"Environmental liability
Mobility companies in the EV space frequently advertise the environmental
benefits of battery-electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Consumers,
investors, and regulatory authorities are paying more attention to companies’
public statements and are insisting on disclosure of environmental, social, and
governance (ESG) programs.

Reputational risk
Underlying the set of risks in the mobility sector is reputational risk. This can
be triggered by various actions, from a cyber incident to failure to comply with
regulations, to accidents that cause bodily injuries or deaths. A failure or defect in
a component produced by a supplier can pose a significant reputational risk to the
original equipment manufacturer that used the component.

Autonomous and electric vehicles use highly sophisticated engineering and require specialized infrastructure to
support their operations. As a result, they introduce complex and dynamic risks, not only on the road but also
in manufacturing and maintenance. AV and EV technology is introducing a new and more complex era for risk
management for manufacturers, technology suppliers, operators, drivers, and mobility regulators.",,1

Remote working and the speed at which new
technologies, such as cloud-based platforms,
are being adopted, coupled with global players
increasingly using cyber disruption as a critical tool
in their arsenal, means that organizations must
remain vigilant to their cyber security risk. This
accentuates the need for greater scrutiny of IT
security and increased workforce awareness of
malicious and non-malicious cyber attacks.

In a data-driven world powered by digitization,
regulators continue to increase their vigilance,
and data privacy and protection continue to pose
significant challenges to organizations. The European
Union General Data Protection Regulation (EUGDPR), in force since May 2018, should not be
overlooked by organizations. Continued focus on
compliance with the EU-GDPR will prevent large
penalties and reputational risks.

Organizations are held accountable by their internal
and external stakeholders for encouraging an
appropriate culture and standards of integrity.
In order to achieve this, there is a need to define
a set of values to which employees should adhere
within the organizations. For example in the banking
industry, weak culture has been linked to many
historic incidents of loss or fraud. ",,0
883,"Cost

of fuel and other services, such as cabin cleaning and food

vendors, have increased significantly. Higher fares indicate

airlines are looking to pass this cost on to customers, but

whether the strategy will be successful in the longer term

is another issue that respondents identify as a top risk they

may need to contend with in 2023. ",,0
884,"This will likely continue to weaken existing
alliances as nations turn inwards, with enhanced
state intervention perceived to drive a “race to
the bottom”. Further pressure will be placed on
multilateral governance mechanisms that act as
mitigants to these risks, potentially mirroring the
politicization of the World Health Organization
(WHO) during the COVID-19 pandemic and the
near paralysis of trade enforcement on more
contentious issues by the World Trade Organization
(WTO) in recent years.28 It will also likely embed
the importance of broader geopolitical spheres
of influence in “dependent” markets, with global
powers extensively exercising trade, debt and
technological power. Although some developing
and emerging markets may wield critical resources
as leverage, considered in Chapter 3: Resource
Rivalries, anticipated controls on capital, labour,
knowledge and technological flows risk widening the
developmental divide.

In addition, spheres of influence will not be purely
contained to global powers, nor “dependent”
developing and emerging markets. The influence and
alignment of the Middle East in regional and global
politics will shift. Although the challenge of longer 2023   20
term economic diversification remains a significant
distraction domestically, the current energy crisis
will raise economic, military and political capital
of numerous countries over the next two years.

The need to address the risks and benefits of digital assets at a federal level is becoming
increasingly clear. In the US, for example, President Biden issued an executive order directing
federal agencies and financial regulators to develop frameworks that, among other priorities,
protect consumers, businesses, and investors. The administration also calls for research into
a United States Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) — a digital form of the US dollar.

For those organizations that either have already adopted digital asset practices or are
exploring opportunities — as 50% of our survey respondents are (see Figure 6) — these
factors and a fluctuating digital asset market have increased their focus on insurance
solutions. However, organizations should start with evaluating their strategic objectives and
risk profile, and have that inform their insurance strategy.

Level setting
To create the initial risk assessment framework, it’s important to understand the extent
of the organization’s involvement in the digital asset space, namely whether these
will be used internally or externally and if they will be managed in-house of through
a third party partnership.

887,"“There is a risk that there
will be many companies who are good at
communicating on environmental risk,
but poor at managing it.”

But, he says, chief audit executives must
accept that it will be a long journey, not
least because the activity is in its infancy.
In his view, the risk of green-washing is
partly an outcome of having relatively
low levels of maturity in the

non-financial reporting standards currently
available and in development. He sees
a parallel with the development of more
stringent capital adequacy requirements,
particularly the self-assessment of risks,
that arose in the financial services industry
following the economic crisis of 2007-2008.

“From that example, it is easy to see
that it will take time for KPIs around
environmental reporting to make sense and
become properly comparable,” he says.

888,"Industry coalitions are
working with future-focused governments to establish
the incentives, policy frameworks, standards and
certifications, and circularity-focused capabilities that
are necessary to scale.11 In some markets, business
models are being transformed to decrease demand
and increase both the recovery potential and actual
recovery of metals and minerals, partially mitigating
the demand-supply gap going forward.

Despite these efforts and continued climate
ambitions, higher prices and shortages are slowing
momentum for the green energy transition in the
short-term. In lower-income economies without local
minerals and metals assets, the promise of support
with green energy infrastructure is partly unfulfilled,
and some are considering reverting to carbonintensive energy sources to secure energy.12

• Create effective compensation and

total rewards packages. Consider
offering spot bonuses based on
tenure or skills, get creative with
remote work, or offer a four-day
workweek, in addition to delivering
on total well-being.

• Understand what employees value
and align this with a business purpose

engagement, flexibility, and career
opportunities, like on-demand training.

• Deliver and reimagine total well-being
by reviewing healthcare affordability,

soaring costs associated with the energy crisis,
supply chain disruptions and noticeable staffing
shortages are jeopardizing many companies’

some chief audit executives attending
the roundtable said they had tried to
use predictive analytics to help them
understand when the conditions in the

said one chief audit executive, “but there

advanced data analytics pilots, which he
expects to launch this year. That comprises
over 55 scripts that query and monitor core
areas twice a year, such as procurement,

management team would help the part of
the business affected deal with the event

several crises arose in a year, people would
be rotated in and out of the team because of
the intense nature of the work. These types
of arrangements have been fundamentally
broken by recent events because it is beyond
the scope of a crisis management structure

management and disaster response fifth
as the risk area where they spent most time
and effort – compared with fourth in the

In many industries, the entire enterprise has
effectively become the crisis management
team whether they have been prepared for
it or not. In addition, says Martin, the impact
of such threats can jump unpredictably from
one area of a business to another within
days, weeks and months - in effect creating
sub-crises of differing intensities - in a way
that makes resource allocation critical.

only country in the survey to see this trend – following its
recent easing of long-in-place restrictions.

Despite positive moves to diversify business models
and supply chains since the pandemic, businesses
continue to experience significant disruption around
the world. Covid-19 came as a massive shock, creating
global shortages, delays and higher prices, while the
war in Ukraine triggered an energy crisis in Europe,
turbocharging inflation.

Given the current ‘permacrisis’, business interruption and
supply chain disruption (BI) ranks as the second top risk
in this year’s Allianz Risk Barometer (34% of responses),
second only to cyber risk, with which it is closely interlinked
and separated by only a few votes.

health – to be an enduring feature of the future risk landscape.

This is especially true as the expected spread and persistence of
geopolitical tensions feed directly into concern about cyber risks.
When asked about the main concern that motivated them to
choose this risk, experts this year were marginally more likely
than last year to cite shutdown of critical infrastructure and
essential services (51% vs 47% in 2021). Conflicts between nation
states are a major risk factor for attacks targeting a country’s
essential services, such as health systems – which are already
under severe strain in many countries, as they seek to deal with

Scenario ten: Russia-Ukraine conflict turns into global war

Very low probability; Very high impact
The war in Ukraine could become a global conflict, pitting Russia against NATO members. The war
carries particular risks for NATO member states that border Ukraine and Russia, which could be
drawn into the conflict inadvertently. Russia has readied its nuclear deterrence forces and could
target critical infrastructure (such as gas pipelines or undersea telecommunications cables). In case of

a forced transformation of the economy in the direction of
decarbonization as well as increased risk awareness in all

small-size companies, cyber incidents maintains
its top position. Both business interruption

inflation will squeeze Canadians as rising interest rates and slowing growth prompt a sharp housing market correction, increase unemployment, and put fiscal pressures on indebted households, businesses, and governments.

These are manageable economic shocks. But two political factors are likely to make things worse. First, Canada’s
hyper-polarized political parties, divided along regional lines, will amplify rural-urban and eastern-western tensions for political gain.

Second, declining trust in traditional media outlets, combined with Canada’s deep and unique exposure to the US
political and media ecosystem—which manifests in cross-border political links, transnational special interest groups,
Canadian consumption of US cable news and talk radio, and connections between US and Canadian far-right and farleft fringe groups (especially on social media)—will facilitate contagion from the divided republic to the south.

This means that Canada’s combative partisan and regional politics are poised to take a turn for the worse. In Ottawa, inflammatory attacks on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of the Liberal Party will be met by attempts to paint
the Conservative opposition as a Canadian version of Trumpism. Both are overegged … but will gain traction. ",,0
921,"For example, the severity and frequency of flooding events associated

with extreme precipitation events and tropical cyclones is predicted to increase with average global

temperatures. Globally increasing sea levels in combination with stronger storm surges will amplify the

risk in coastal areas over time. Heat-waves are likely to occur more frequently and last longer as average

global temperatures increase, with impacts on both property and agriculture, (droughts, wildfire) but also

on life/health insurance due to excess mortality (e.g. US, Canada and Europe in 2021). More expensive

construction of properties, including interior fittings (e.g. smart home, thermal insulation, etc.)and continued

concentration of exposures in coastal areas / on river flood plains further amplify loss costs.

As the climate system is highly non-linear, the triggering of so called climate tipping points (e.g. thawing of

Siberian permafrost or collapse of Gulf stream) can drastically accelerate the current trends towards more

extreme weather, as well as having broader consequences on climate and ecosystems, as soon as critical

thresholds are exceeded.

to limit any future global crisis that might occur: trust in scientists, for example, has fallen to 66%
from 75% in last year’s survey; members of the public are also less likely to trust international
institutions (64% to 61%), national authorities (62% to 58%), civil society (56% to 53%) and
private companies (47% to 45%).

Among experts, levels of trust are generally higher, and the trend is more mixed. Trust in scientists
has also fallen – from 87% to 82% – along with trust in companies; but trust in international
organizations, national authorities and civil society has improved.

Telecommunications
Risk Factor Survey

The wave of opportunity: growing risks
for greater benefits
2

Telecoms are experiencing unprecedented
demand for their services. At the same time,
new challenges are appearing with
unprecedented speed.

The capital expenditure needed to build out
network infrastructure for 5G is a prime
example. On one hand, 5G opens possibilities
for delivering new products and services. On the
other, the vast expenses create economic risks
across the board — doubly so during times of
increased macroeconomic uncertainty.

INTRODUCTION

Simultaneously, telecoms see competition
appearing from angles which would, until
recently, have been borderline unthinkable, for
example, Elon Musk’s StarLink internet service
provider, but many other companies are
leveraging cloud and satellite networks to offer
communication solutions.

BDO’s 2022 Telecommunications Risk Factor
Survey explores how telecoms across the globe
view the risk landscape facing them. It charts how
the view of specific risks has evolved, and what
strategies and initiatives may mitigate said risks.

mobile computers, equipped with sensors and software that
can control almost every function, from assisted driving to safety
and infotainment. Tech companies are supplying maps and voice
assistant technologies to car makers. Some large tech companies
are working on autonomous driving technologies—and may even
have ambitions to produce their own branded vehicles and to offer
self-driving rideshare services.49 In real estate, Internet of Things
(IoT) sensors and smart devices are being installed in homes, offices,
and warehouses; analytics on the resulting data flows can lead to
energy use optimization and smarter inventory management.50 In
manufacturing, deploying smart factory solutions that combine
a variety of capabilities—including industrial IoT, cloud and edge
computing, private 5G networks, RPA, AI, vision systems, and
augmented and virtual reality—has been shown to improve cost,
throughput, quality, safety, and revenues.51 And in retail, augmented

Moderate probability; Moderate impact
Major central banks are rapidly raising interest rates to try to tame rising inflation across most countries
around the world (we assume that global inflation will stand at nearly 10% this year). These measures
are fuelling a sharp increase in long-term interest rates, raising borrowing costs. A prolonged rise in
inflation could prompt central banks to maintain aggressive policies that would undermine household

political risks and violence is a new entry in the top 10

When we asked experts to rate each risk as
“slowly emerging”, “rapidly emerging” or
“already there”, the top two risks in the “rapidly
emerging” category were both technological:
technology-related economic risks (50%)
and disruptive technologies (48%).
Among technology-related economic risks,
the most-cited concern – mentioned by 38%
of respondents last year and 41% this year – was
related to cryptocurrencies and digital tokens.

Disruptive technologies remain towards
the bottom end of the rankings overall, though
slightly increased this year compared to last
among both experts (up from 21st to 20th) and the
general public (24th to 23rd).
After a year of hype about the metaverse,
advanced human-machine interfaces and virtual
and augmented reality continued to be the
concerns most cited by respondents who chose
this risk.

Artificial intelligence (AI) and big data is another
technology-related risk that was widely
considered as “rapidly emerging” (46%). ",1.0,0
940,"One risk scenario on the minds of manufacturers, consumers, and
regulators is an AV getting hacked and remotely controlled, causing the vehicle to injure people or cause property damage.

Supply chain
As a global industry, mobility has complex supply chains spanning most of the developed world. A semiconductor shortage
that began during the coronavirus pandemic has stabilized, but the lack of chips is still causing backlogs in vehicle
inventory. The next bottleneck in the supply chain may be related to having sufficient batteries to keep EV and charging
station facilities running. As demand for EVs continues to rise, the battery manufacturing supply chain must keep pace.
Societies must also continue to build out the infrastructure needed to recharge vehicles on longer trips, especially since an
inadequate charging infrastructure may dampen enthusiasm for EV.

As EV production increases, consolidation among suppliers is a strong possibility for certain key components. Few
manufacturers are prepared for such consolidation and its impact on supply chain risks. An example of this risk is Taiwan,
which makes a majority of the world’s advanced microchips for many industries, not just automotive. ",,0
941,"Owing to conflicts such as the Russian
invasion of Ukraine and geopolitical tensions in Asia, tech companies
may witness product shortages and delays, service disruptions,
bankruptcy of core suppliers, increased product costs, and reduced
global sales in the months ahead.29 Additionally, tech companies
that have prior purchase commitments with their suppliers will be
constrained to buy components at higher prices than those available
in the current market, which will affect gross margins. In 2023, tech
companies should consider revising supplier agreements to reflect
new circumstances.

Geopolitical tensions, embargoes, and trade restrictions are notably
affecting the chip industry, causing downstream disruptions for
tech and other industries. Deloitte’s 2023 Semiconductor Industry
Outlook anticipates that there will likely be a surfeit of some chips,
while others remain in short supply.30 Ensuring a reliable supply of
chips is expected to remain crucial for the stability of many markets,
and 2023 may see tech companies finding the right mix of expansion,
new plants, and “friendshoring”31 to localize the chip supply chain
and help make it more resilient.

“The maturation of business models
around cybercrime is becoming a major
threat,” the chief audit executive of an
international IT company says. He says that
the ability of low-skilled hackers to buy
sophisticated off-the-shelf attacks should
be on every internal audit team’s radar.
“It is now an open battlefield and auditors
should ensure they keep up-to-date
on the main evolutions in cyber-attack
strategies.” While technicians are best
placed to develop and deploy defences,
he says, internal auditors should help to
effectively spread new counter measures
and advice from those teams throughout
the organisation.

Risk Definition

This risk relates to the challenges organizations face when planning for their talent needs

in a rapidly shifting labor market. While consumer demand has tapered in some sectors

and overall economic growth trends are moderate, the U.S. labor market continues to be

tight overall. Meanwhile, changing requirements around pay transparency and

noncompete clauses are beginning to reshape employer-employee dynamics.

Labor market complexity and mixed economic signals point to significant risks that

organizations could fail to navigate appropriately, either by setting the wrong hiring

targets or miscalculating the scale of potential layoffs. Errors in either direction could

significantly disadvantage organizations relative to competitors.

1 TOP RISKS: GLOBALIZATION AT A CROSSROADS

Global trends in geopolitics and macro-economics
are driving deglobalization and trade regionalization.
Rising geopolitical tensions–most importantly between
the US and China – are increasing policy risks, and these
risks are compounded by recent economic instability.

This international policy environment will particularly
affect deglobalization in trade and technology supply
chains. For instance, China’s efforts to leverage market
access and export dependence to gain support for its
foreign policy ambitions have driven many Western
governments to tighten their own export controls and
take stock of supply chain vulnerabilities to mitigate
strategic risks.

The Biden administration has largely maintained its
predecessor’s policy with tariffs on Chinese goods and
encourages reshoring and “friendshoring” more broadly.
At the same time, Western-led sanctions on Moscow
following its invasion of Ukraine are reshaping and
deglobalizing energy markets along geopolitical lines.

Even where multilateral trade policy remains robust,
agreements increasingly reflect geopolitical alignments
and seek to shape global standards accordingly.
",,0
957,"Threats relating to climate change,
health and geopolitical tensions have
already materialized visibly. One big
threat that has not materialized, and
may do so in the near future, is a
large-scale cyber-attack crippling
essential infrastructure such as health
services, energy storage or payment
systems. Cyber risks are compounded
by geopolitical tensions and the
digitalization of our daily lives, and
continue to rank high in this year’s
survey – in 3rd position among
experts. While pandemic-related risks
drop to 5th, the survey overall points
to both cyber and wider health risks
– such as mental health and changing
patterns of infectious diseases –
becoming entrenched as a “new
normal” in the overall risk landscape.

Insurance has historically been an enabler in
the face of uncertainty. From maritime voyages
and fire insurance to the development of
terrorism, nuclear and IT insurance, insurers –
often working alongside governments – have
long played a critical role in facilitating business
and cooperation in conditions of geopolitical
instability, whether related to the emergence of
new technologies or novel threats more broadly.

understand how insights about emerging risks can be used

organization’s ability to pivot when the unexpected occurs.

That can translate into sustainable competitive advantage.

To help executives and boards better identify potential risks

on the horizon, Protiviti and NC State University’s ERM

Initiative are pleased to provide this report focusing on the

top risks currently on the minds of boards of directors and

senior executives around the globe. This report contains

results from our 11th annual worldwide risk survey of

directors and executives to obtain their views on the

extent to which a broad collection of risks is likely to affect

their organizations over the next year — 2023. In addition

to insights about near-term risks in 2023, we also asked

respondents to consider how these risks will affect their

organizations a decade from now (in 2032).  ",,0
959,"There is noticeable variation among

different leaders about what risks are most critical,

highlighting the importance of engaging in conversations

about the most significant risks for their organizations.

• A long-term view of risks is vital in navigating the

near term. As organizations manage the challenges

2023 brings, they should also prepare for the long term

by addressing issues noted in this survey, including

effectively transforming legacy IT infrastructures,

emphasizing the customer experience, investing in future

growth opportunities, ensuring privacy and security, and

advancing capabilities to deploy advanced data analytics.

A long-term outlook helps companies focus on where to

invest to be more resilient for the unexpected and better

prepared for the next phase of growth.

The top 10 risks for both 2023 and a decade later (2032)

are highlighted in the charts that follow. As indicated by the

red arrows, each of the top 10 risks for 2023 is rated higher

than it was for 2022, and each of the 2032 risks is higher

than last year’s survey that looked out to 2031.

961,"Scenario four: high global inflation fuels social unrest

Very high probability; Moderate impact
Persistent inflationary pressures, caused by supply-chain disruptions and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,
are pushing up global inflation, which is at its highest level since the 1990s. If inflation rises much higher
than wage increases, making it hard for poorer households to purchase basic staples, it could spark
social unrest. Such protest movements have arisen in India, Ecuador and Argentina. In an extreme
scenario, protests could push workers in major economies and employed by large manufacturers to coordinate large-scale strikes demanding higher salaries that match inflation. Such movements, similar to
those that have affected critical services in the UK (ports, postal services, barristers and railways), could
paralyse entire industries and spill over to other sectors or countries, weighing on global growth.

Scenario five: new variant of coronavirus, or another infectious disease, sends
global economy back into recession

Moderate probability; Very high impact
Amid global vaccine inequity, the relaxation of government policies and pandemic fatigue, we
expect a new variant of covid-19 to emerge in late 2022 or early 2023. If it escapes immunity
(despite a reformulation of vaccines), this could cause a repeat of 2020. ",,0

where the company stands on climate change and
what it really wants to achieve compared with
regulations, competitors and societal expectations.

2. Understand the company’s goals and current
maturity on climate-related sustainability and assess
how far this is reflected in the business and action
plans on different levels.

organisation’s impact on the environment and the
environment’s impact on the business – the issue of
double materiality.

968,"Amid other destabilising factors (for
example the war in Ukraine, supply-chain disruptions, the strength of the US dollar and China’s zerocovid policy), this situation could trigger a global recession. In developed countries, the economic
slowdown could deepen, resulting in an asset market crash that would weigh on global growth. In
emerging markets, interest-rate rises could prompt extreme currency depreciations and raise the risk
of sovereign debt defaults (as happened in Sri Lanka in April).

Scenario nine: China’s zero-covid policy leads to severe recession

Low probability; High impact
China’s government continues to believe covid-19 containment measures to be necessary. We
therefore expect China’s zero-covid policy to persist until mid-2023. With another coronavirus variant
likely to emerge this winter, strict lockdown measures in China remain probable. These, combined
with the persistent weakness in China’s property sector, energy sector woes and a recent drought,
could cause China’s economy to contract severely. This would weigh on global economic activity,
deteriorating already weak investor sentiment and dampening the performance of global financial
markets. International companies could diversify their operations to non-China-based manufacturing

969,"An indifferent response to Russian aggression could
invite a global backlash, undermining China’s international
standing and adding to economic risks. China’s foreign
policymaking would be less marked by overzealousness and
miscues if it was informed by effective debate and feedback
on likely global responses. In this, as in other critical policy
areas, Xi will be listening to no one more than himself.

The last time a Chinese leader had this much power to pursue
such a misguided policy agenda, the result was widespread
famine, economic ruin, and death. While another Cultural
Revolution or Great Leap Forward is unlikely given the size
of China’s educated urban middle class, Xi’s consolidation of
power will take China at least a few steps backward this year.

to increase the risk of confrontation with Iran this year.

With a nuclear deal out of reach, the gloves will again come
off between Iran and Israel. Israel’s new prime minister,
Binyamin Netanyahu, has been committed for decades
to setting back Iran’s nuclear advances. Israel will likely

concentrated in Africa, with rapid growth constituting both an opportunity and a threat to its development objectives.

The 2022 midterm elections halted the slide toward a constitutional crisis at the next U.S. presidential election as voters rejected virtually all candidates running for state governor or state attorney general who denied or questioned the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election. But the U.S. remains one of the most politically polarized and dysfunctional of the world’s advanced industrial democracies heading into 2023. Extreme policy divergences between red and blue states will make it harder for U.S. and foreign companies to treat the U.S. as a single coherent market, despite obvious economic strengths. And the risk of political violence remains high.
9- Tik Tok boom
Born between the mid-1990s and the early 2010s, Generation Z is the first with no experience of life without the internet. Digital devices and social media have connected them across borders to create the first truly global generation. And that makes them a new political and geopolitical actor, especially in the U.S. and Europe. Gen Z has both the ability and the motivation to organize online to reshape corporate and public policy, making life harder for companies everywhere and disrupting politics with the click of a button.

been to up-skill their teams – a difficulty
for all departments given the struggle to
attract and retain high-quality staff into
internal auditing, an issue raised by most
Risk in Focus 2023 roundtable participants
under all topics covered by this year’s
report. Understanding the complex global
regulatory landscape and its potential
significance for the business can be a
major undertaking and many businesses
seek help from external audit firms and
global consultancies. But it is only half the
picture. The other is being able to bring
in engineers, scientists and other experts
to help with building subject matter
expertise. While some assistance can be
found within the business, increasingly
chief audit executives are turning to
external sources for help to source such
experts. Internal auditors must ensure their
departments have access to the right skills

and knowledge to get on top of climaterelated risk before it is too late.

looming for some of the world’s most vulnerable
nations. Inequality is growing and for the first time in
20 years poverty is on the rise. The World Bank is
sounding the alarm on low global growth prospects
and even the risk of stagflation (See Bottom Line #2).

As the war continues into 2023, with no signs of a
resolution in sight, Western allies plan to maintain
sanctions and export controls on Russia and remain
broadly aligned in staunch support of Ukraine.
Businesses will be forced to manage ongoing and
complex additional restrictions, highlighting the
critical need for due diligence and compliance
structures.

This will likely increase operating costs and hamper
efficiency. Sanctions, ongoing high commodity
prices and reputational damage are therefore
among the main challenges facing companies
operating in foreign jurisdictions in 2023. A tail risk

such conditions will affect the ability of some companies
to make improvements to cyber security or respond
effectively to an incident.

Good cyber hygiene

“At AGCS our risk assessment experience shows that a
number of companies still need to improve areas of cyber
hygiene such as frequency of IT security training, cyber
incident response plans and cyber-security governance,”
says Sayce. “Incident response is critical as the cost of a
claim quickly escalates once business interruption kicks in.

“It is clear that organizations with good cyber maturity
are better equipped to deal with incidents. It is not typical
to see companies with strong cyber maturity and security
mechanisms suffer a high frequency of ‘successful’
attacks. Even where they are attacked, losses are usually
less severe.”

The good news is that insurers are now having very
different conversations with firms on the quality of cyber
risk compared to just a couple of years ago. This means
they are gaining much better insights which can, in
turn, help to provide more value through offering useful
information and advice to customers and companies
of all sizes, such as which controls are most effective
or where to further improve risk management and
response approaches.

Various hazardous particles and substances can have a negative impact on human health. Among these are

chemicals that act as endocrine disruptors, altering functions of the body’s hormone messenger system in

a way that may cause adverse health effects (e.g. cancer, neurological and reproductive problems). Many

chemicals can be harmful to the environment or health if inhaled, ingested or absorbed through the skin. In

particular, chemicals that are carcinogenic, bioaccumulative or have the character of “forever chemicals”

pose a high risk. Another group are nanoparticles, where the inherent risks throughout the product life cycle

are sometimes unclear, but sometimes clear enough to have already led to action (such as the EU banning

nano titanium dioxide in food). Microplastics are a further concern due to their ubiquity paired with lack of

scientific insights into their impacts on ecosystems and on health. For many substances, their widespread

use, chemical stability and accumulation through the food chain and lifespan make them prone to serial and

cumulative losses. There is the potential for long latent major losses in various insurance sectors including

zero-Covid policy, locking down the global economy’s most important manufacturing and shipping hubs. Finally, Russia’s
invasion of Ukraine and the West’s sanctions in response put a strain on the global supply of energy, food, and fertilizer.

This unprecedented confluence of overlapping shocks pushed inflation to levels most countries hadn’t seen in nearly 50
years. At first, central bankers believed the mounting price pressures would be “transitory” and kept policy too loose for
too long. Once they realized their mistake, they were forced to respond to prevent inflation expectations from becoming
unmoored. The US Federal Reserve took the lead with aggressive interest rate hikes and balance-sheet reduction in 2022,
prompting others to follow suit.

Though the end of the tightening cycle is now in sight, central banks will maintain a restrictive policy stance through

world. The focus today is on agility and resilience as much

as it is on prevention and detection.

Given the disruptive environment, now may be an opportune

time for boards and C-suites to examine closely how their

organizations approach risk management and oversight in

the digital age to pinpoint aspects requiring improvement.

Managing today’s risks using outdated techniques and

tools may leave the organization exposed to significant,

undesirable and potentially disruptive risk events that could

obviate its strategy and business model and threaten its

brand and reputation — even its very survival.

Accordingly, in the interest of evaluating and improving

risk management capabilities in light of the findings in this

report, we offer executives and directors the following

diagnostic questions to consider when evaluating their

organization’s risk assessment and risk management

processes. A “no” response to any of the following questions

should be considered as a possible area of improvement.

1002,"If the risk rankings are changing rapidly,
the areas on which internal auditors spend
their time appears to be relatively static
– raising the question of whether some
functions need to be more agile to meet
the changing needs of their organisations.
Human capital, for example, moved
up from 11th place in 2022 to 10th this
year in terms of time and effort spent on
this risk area, despite the huge pressure
organisations are under to attract, retain,
train and protect the well-being of staff.
Organisational governance and corporate
reporting, on the other hand, held its
position as the second biggest area that

received internal audit’s attention. How
well internal audit departments continue
to align their efforts to the needs of
their organisations is likely to become
more of a pressing issue as large-scale
interconnected risks continue to rise with
unprecedented speed in the years to come.

Not surprisingly, #1 Rogue Russia is a highly central risk. That is not to say it is the most severe
risk, in fact #3 Weapons of Mass Disruptionwas deemed most catastrophic if fully triggered.
Instead, the DRA shows that an unpredictable Russia constitutes the most influential risk in the

likely due to executives’ concerns about extreme weather

threats and supply chain issues intensifying due to recent

improvement over the past year in their ability to recruit

and hold on to in-demand talent in a labor market that

remains tight.

Energy and utilities businesses are still struggling to hire

and train enough skilled talent to replace experienced

personnel retiring from the workforce in growing numbers

— and often earlier than expected. Many companies face

an uphill climb in convincing younger workers that they

can offer a rewarding career path. The need to secure

highly specialized technical skills for jobs in areas such

as renewables is another obstacle to energy companies

overcoming critical staffing challenges.

Other trends are poised to exacerbate the energy and

utilities industry’s “people problem” — as evidenced

by the fourth and fifth risks for 2023. “Changes in the

The energy crisis: moving forward

In the course of the green transformation,
relative prices will also change. Carbon prices
make energy consumption more expensive,
and regulations and standards will drive up the
prices of housing and food, for example. This will
affect different income groups differently.

“Even if their energy consumption is generally
lower, lower income groups will suffer
particularly from rising prices. Therefore, more
needs to be done over the long-term to protect
the most vulnerable households,” says Subran.

on supply chain risks and their impact on the budgeting

various industries reported that their companies are

passing along higher supply chain costs to their customers.

This approach clearly isn’t sustainable as it could lead to

customer experience and customer loyalty downfalls —

even for companies at the helm of omnichannel.

Companies struggling with their supply chains can

benefit from improving inventory management, such as

using a greater number of smaller warehouses (micro
warehouses) for easier access to products without relying

on long-distance shipping. It is critical for companies to

have enough inventory to respond to consumer demand

without carrying excess inventory and increased costs.  130

Recent advances represent a step-change in the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to manipulate people and disrupt society, and 2023 will be a tipping point for this trend. A new form, known as generative AI, will allow users to create realistic images, videos, and text with just a few sentences of guidance. Large language models will pass the Turing test—a Rubicon for machines’ ability to imitate human intelligence. Advances in deepfakes, facial recognition, and voice synthesis software will render control over one’s likeness a relic of the past.

the shift in spending patterns to goods rather than
services, and the COVID-19-related disruptions in
logistics networks have generated significant
inflationary pressures. These pressures have not
eased in recent months; the war in Ukraine has
caused severe economic consequences in
Europe and in case the Netherlands with global
ramifications. It is important to consider its various
commercial, logistical, legal and broader geological
impacts (including the complex sanctions regime).
Furthermore, due to the unprecedented increase in
gas and oil prices, but also in commodity prices, the
inflation continues to rise and the purchasing power
of many households is declining. As a controlling
measure, the different central banks have started
to raise interest rates. These ongoing global
developments are creating new day-to-day risks in

Our survey respondents see a world of transformation,

innovation and disruptive change amid challenges relating

to people, culture, security and resiliency. Over the next

10 years, their critical priorities include the acquisition and

retention of talent and reskilling and upskilling existing

employees to sustain their organization's relevance and

realize the full potential of its transformation journey. With

incumbents facing more agile business models, technology

is now the path forward rather than a mere tool.

Following are steps companies should undertake or

continue over the near term to ensure they can increase

their agility and sustain their transformation journey

successfully over the long term:

• Modernize legacy applications — Address accumulated

“technical debt” to drive efficiency in business and IT

systems, reduce infrastructure costs by streamlining

services and moving core applications and services to

the cloud, and improve capacity to innovate to enrich

customer experiences, digitize products and services,

inform decision-making, and compete with “born digital”

players with architecture built optimally from the

Audit Plan Hot Spots 1H23 Update: Workforce
Management, IT Governance and Organizational
Resilience
Published 29 March 2023 - ID G00786989 - 33 min read

By Analyst(s): Audit Research Team

Initiatives: Audit Planning and Risk Coverage; Risk and Control Resources for Internal

Auditors

This 1H23 Audit Plan Hot Spots update highlights three areas of

volatility: workforce management, IT governance and

organizational resilience. Chief audit executives should update their

risk assessments and audit plans to account for these trends.

Overview
The 2023 Audit Plan Hot Spots report highlighted 12 risk areas for chief audit executives

(CAEs) to include in audit plans. Since then, the landscape has evolved rapidly for

workforce management, IT governance and organizational resilience. Retention and

recruitment dynamics have become more difficult, with conflicting labor market trends

and the rollout of greater pay transparency requirements. The advent of open access to

generative AI tools such as ChatGPT is quickly reshaping IT governance, and

organizations are also facing stricter compliance standards for employee use of personal

devices and third-party messaging apps. ",,0

clients lose money, we have to compensate

technology industry faces global challenges ranging from geopolitical
tensions to supply chain uncertainties, ongoing semiconductor

The Top 10 Global Risks of 2023

hreats to the future of democracy look overrated these days, given the glaring leadership weaknesses now evident in Russia, China, and Iran. Add relief that the U.S. midterm election came off with few of the stresses we saw in 2020. And don’t overlook increasingly strong cohesion in EU policymaking.
But there are still important (and growing) risks to preoccupy world leaders, business decisionmakers, and the rest of us in 2023. Here are the ten most important.
1- Rogue Russia
A cornered Russia will turn from global player into the world’s most dangerous rogue state, posing a serious and pervasive danger to Europe, the U.S., and beyond. Bogged down in Ukraine, with little to lose from further isolation and Western retaliation, and facing intense domestic pressure to show strength, Russia will turn to asymmetric warfare against the West to inflict damage through a thousand “paper cuts” rather than by overt aggression that depends on military and economic power that Russia no longer has.
Putin’s nuclear saber-rattling will escalate. Kremlin-affiliated hackers will ramp up increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks on Western firms, governments, and infrastructure. ",,0

Clarifying risk
appetite
Marnoch and his team are engaging in
what he calls “stronger conversations
about risk appetite”. He says having a clear
understanding of how much risk each
business can take on in specific areas is most
useful during a dilemma - where all choices
may have potential upsides and downsides.
Then, clarity on the appetite for the risks
associated with the different choices can act
as a guiding light through the problem.

Syndrome

Metabolic syndrome is mainly understood as the combination of obesity, hypertension and diabetes in

individual patients. It is associated with the risk of developing severe and chronic complications such as

myocardial infarction, stroke or kidney and liver disease. About 20-25% of the world’s adult population may

be affected and the prevalence is predicted to increase in the future. Metabolic syndrome has a negative

impact on life expectancy and healthcare costs, but also has a liability aspect.

Martin agreed with Schlegel that while in
the past, crises generally were contained in
one or two areas of the business, now they
infuse all aspects of an organisation with
urgency and a heightened sense of threat –
but enterprises that are not properly trained
through global crisis management exercises

Regulatory compliance
Numerous regulations have an impact on the mobility industry, and keeping up
with changing regulations in different jurisdictions is challenging. For example,
the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union has inspired
similar regulation in the United States.

Supply chain regulations are pushing for manufacturers and suppliers to provide
greater transparency and allow for monitoring of where materials originate. This
kind of regulation is a particular challenge for manufacturers of EV batteries,
which require metals and rare earth minerals. Most of the world’s supplies of
these materials are mined in developing countries.

Product liability
Most incumbent original equipment manufacturers do not purchase product
liability insurance and, instead, tend to seek to mitigate their own exposure to
product liability through contractual risk transfer to their suppliers. Makers of
advanced driver assistance systems and other AV technologies are therefore likely
to see their product liability exposure increase.

compared to “Geoeconomic confrontation” and
Misinformation and disinformation over the

clashes between global powers. Prior to 2022,
militarization had fallen in all regions, with recent
data showing an overall decline in nearly 70% of the
countries covered by the Global Peace Index 2022

Acting today

Averting tipping points requires a combination of
conservation efforts, interventions to transform the
food system, accelerated and nature-positive climate
mitigation strategies, and changes to consumption
and production patterns. This involves realigning
incentives and upgrading governance structures,
fueled by better data and tools to capture the
interdependencies of food, climate, energy and
ecosystems.

There are already initial signs of shifts in this
direction. The increasing visibility and influence of
multilateral and market-led initiatives such as the
Taskforce for Nature-related Financial Disclosures
(TFND) set to launch later this year, are positive
developments. The 15th Conference of Parties to
the Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD COP15)
resulted in the Montreal-Kunming agreement, setting
out new global targets for 2030 such as reforming
environmentally damaging subsidy systems and

restoring 30% of the planet’s degraded ecosystems.

Pandemic aftershocks meet
silent health crises

Global health outcomes have been weakened by
the COVID-19 pandemic, with lingering effects.
Early evidence points to a post-COVID-19 condition
impacting the quality of life and occupational status
of individuals – contributing to work absences
and early retirements, tighter labour markets and
a decline in economic productivity. The resulting
economic hit is estimated to be from roughly
$140-600 billion to up to $3.7 trillion in the United
States of America, and close to AUD$5 billion per
year in Australia if current costs persist, reflecting
loss of quality of life, lost earnings and output, and
higher spending on medical care.27 The pandemic
also diverted resources from other diseases
such as cancer screening and tuberculosis,28
and immunization campaigns were put on hold.
",,0
1089,"In America,
stubbornly high interest rates could also
start taking a toll on the global economy.

Businesses have a few mitigation options:

Reduce costs through efficiency and
productivity gains.

Harnessing new technologies can help (see Bottom
Line #3), as can supply chain restructuring to
circumvent shortages and soaring input costs. For
example, companies in Europe that are struggling with
high energy costs (i.e., chemicals and heavy
industries) – especially those in countries traditionally
over-reliant on Russian gas – are already shifting
manufacturing to less impacted locations.

Pass cost increases on to consumers

Companies with high pricing power and strong brand
recognition may be well placed. Either because they
sell essential goods with inelastic demand or because
consumers trust and buy into their brand narrative.
Another reason why a genuine ESG strategy will be
essential in 2023. Yet leaders should be wary of a
tipping point in price hikes, beyond which customers
will shift to cheaper substitutes.

Adjust wages

Leaders will likely face mounting pressure to increase
wages to offset the cost-of living crisis at a time when
market conditions are getting tougher and lay-offs might
become necessary. ",,0

threats will become more explicit; he’s likely to move
tactical nuclear weapons closer to Ukraine—and publicize

Russia’s nuclear arsenal. Russia will calibrate its nuclear
threats, and direct nuclear use remains unlikely; Putin is
as Armageddon-averse as Iran’s supreme leader. But the
risk is clear: Nuclear signaling is easier said than done, and
the potential for mutually assured destruction because of
accidents and miscalculation will be higher in 2023 than at
any time since the Cuban missile crisis in 1962. And unlike
the height of the Cold War, Putin has no way to climb down
or return to a pre-war status quo.

1091,"“Increasingly we see that business leaders see
the value in investing more time and money in
understanding what a business continuity plan
can achieve, even if in the first instance it only
raises awareness on vulnerabilities to critical
suppliers,” says Marianna Grammatika, a
Regional Head of Risk Consulting at AGCS.

The Allianz Risk Barometer results show
that companies have begun to diversify their
businesses and supply chains, as well as
stepping up risk management. According to
respondents, the most common action taken by
companies to de-risk supply chains and make
them more resilient is to develop alternative
and/or multiple suppliers (64% of responses,
see graphic). Broadening geographical
diversification of supplier networks in response
to geopolitical trends is the third most common
action (40%).

transform business models, making them
more flexible, adaptable and dynamic than
previously,” says Georgi Pachov, Head
of Portfolio Steering & Pricing at AGCS.
",,0
1092,"Our global “new normal” is a return
to basics – food, energy, security – problems our
globalized world was thought to be on a trajectory
to solve. These risks are being amplified by the
persistent health and economic overhang of a
global pandemic; a war in Europe and sanctions
that impact a globally integrated economy; and an
escalating technological arms race underpinned
by industrial competition and enhanced state
intervention. Longer-term structural changes to

geopolitical dynamics – with the diffusion of power
across countries of differing political and economic
systems – are coinciding with a more rapidly
changing economic landscape, ushering in a lowgrowth, low-investment and low-cooperation era
and a potential decline in human development after
decades of progress.

The result is a global risks landscape that feels both
wholly new and eerily familiar. There is a return of
“older” risks that are understood historically but
experienced by few in the current generations
of business leaders and public policy-makers. In
addition, there are relatively new developments
in the global risk landscape. ",,0
1093,"Additionally,
although less likely in more democratically robust
states, an increasing presence of anocracies (those
forms of government that are part democracy,
part autocracy, referred to in Chapter 2.5: Digital
rights) and factionalism may radicalize polarization.
This could lead to increased incidences of threat
campaigns and political violence, hate crimes, violent
protests and even civil war.53

Social and political polarization may also further
reduce the space for collective problem-solving to
address global risks. The far right has been elected
in Italy and are now the second largest party in
Sweden, while the left has resurged in Latin America.
National elections will take place in several G20
countries within the next two years, including the
United States of America, South Africa, Türkiye,
Argentina, Mexico and Indonesia. The election of
less-centrist leaders and adoption of more “extreme”
policies in economic superpowers may fracture
alliances, limit global collaboration and lead to a
more volatile dynamic.

Global Risks 2033:
Tomorrow’s Catastrophes

2

As risks highlighted in the past chapter unfold
today, much-needed attention and resources are
being diverted from global risks that may become
tomorrow’s shocks and crises. The Global Risks
Perceptions Survey (GRPS) addresses a one-,
two- and 10-year horizon. Chapter one addressed
the present and two-year time frame, focusing on
currently unfolding and shorter-term risks. This
chapter focuses on the third time frame: risks that
may have the most severe impact over the next 10
years.

Based on GRPS results, the longer-term global
risks landscape is also dominated by deteriorating
environmental risks (Figure 2.1). More specifically,
climate- and nature-related risks lead the top 10
risks, by severity, that are expected to manifest
over the next decade. Differentiated as separate
risks for the first time in the GRPS, Failure to
mitigate climate change and Failure of climatechange adaptation top the rankings as the most
severe risks on a global scale, followed by Natural
disasters and extreme weather events and
“Biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse”.

GLOBAL LEADER, ENERGY AND UTILITIES INDUSTRY
PRACTICE, PROTIVITI

Operational issues are the priority focus for energy and

utilities executives in 2023 as they seek to guide their

organizations through a time of significant transition and

growth for the industry. Many of these companies are

under intense pressure to modernize their operations,

amplify innovation and adopt new business models to meet

the rapidly rising demand for energy services (including

renewable energy solutions) driven by population growth,

electrification and other trends.

Increased confidence about meeting regulatory

challenges

In our 2022 survey, the top five risks for the energy and

utilities industry were also operational. But the 2023 list

is markedly different from the 2022 list with regard to

regulatory risks. ",,1
1106,"And that makes them a new political and
geopolitical force, especially in the United States and Europe. Gen Z has both the ability and
the motivation to organize online to reshape corporate and public policy, making life harder
for multinationals everywhere and disrupting politics with the click of a button.

Gen Z grew up as America’s post-Cold War dominance waned, revealing leadership failures at home and abroad through
a series of formative historical events: the 2008 financial crisis, the Arab Spring and the Syrian civil war, Brexit, Trump’s
election, the Black Lives Matter movement, the #MeToo reckoning, mass school shootings in the US, the Covid-19
pandemic, and now the Russia-Ukraine war.

The result is a generation radicalized by the turbulent nature of its times and the failure of leaders and existing institutions
to respond. Gen Z has broader expectations, demands, and policy impulses than its predecessors, including a marked
distrust of institutions and traditional channels of political change and economic achievement.

Not only is this generation the most racially and ethnically diverse in Western history, but its members are also more aware
of systemic racism, gender issues, and economic inequality—and they accordingly lean heavily progressive. ",,0
1107,"Israel, and to a lesser extent the United States, will once
again make noisy preparations for an aerial assault on
Iran’s nuclear sites. The chance of an attack in 2023
remains low, given the risks of a devastating regional
conflict, the likelihood that Iran will not take steps that
provoke an attack, and the fact that Iran is not actively
working on technology that is key to the final stages of a
weapon. But in October, when the UN missile ban is set
to expire, Western countries will be poised to trigger the
snapback of prior UN sanctions, if they haven’t done so
already by then. Iran would respond in provocative ways,
by expelling inspectors or resuming efforts to weaponize,
for example. All this significantly elevates the risk of
military attack.

Risks to Gulf states will increase as well. Tehran accuses
Riyadh of fueling the demonstrations inside Iran, and it
could retaliate militarily to both punish Saudi Arabia and
distract the domestic population. Even if the 2019 attacks
on Saudi oil facilities are not repeated, the risks of missile
attacks from Yemen and Iraq are significant. ",,0

team can learn. The longer-term plan is
to continue automating routine audit
assignments to free his team up to focus
on more strategically relevant work.

1109,"• The EU’s proposal for a Directive on corporate
sustainability due diligence is likely to go before the
European Parliament and the European Council
this year. It would apply to firms with 500
employees or more and annual sales of €150
million and it would demand to scrutinize human
rights, environmental and labor standards across
the entirety of their supply chains and ensure their
business (and suppliers) is compatible with
European standards.

This points to another risk for business in 2023
being the proliferation of unilateral policies across
major economies, resulting in a tit-for-tat escalation
that could upend the international system of trade
and investment at a time when multilateral trade
institutions are particularly vulnerable. In such a
zero-sum scenario, there will be winners and losers
based on control of critical resources.

Mapping future globalization scenarios

Having considered the geopolitical drivers of the economic environment, businesses should map and stress-test
possible future scenarios for globalization as they apply to their sector, operations, and strategy. ",,0
1110,"But internal auditors
are uniquely placed to play their part in
developing long-term solutions that have
a real impact on organisations and the
communities they serve. They need to
secure from the board the resources and
remit to tackle the most pressing risks
with urgency.

If there was ever
a time for the
profession to step up
and deliver on its full
potential, it is now.

",,0
1111,"• Boards are most concerned about operational risks while

CEOs are most concerned about strategic risk issues — a

surprising distinction. A majority of executives and boards

rate concerns associated with succession challenges and

economic conditions as “Significant Impact” risks.

• When looking out a decade, risks causing the greatest

concern among executives and boards relate to the

ability of the organization to deploy digital technologies

that are available in the marketplace, concerns about the

rapid speed of disruptive technologies and their impact

on the business, and regulatory change and increased

scrutiny. Four of the executive groups rate those three

concerns as “Significant Impact” risks. Similarly, the

concern about increasing labor costs is rated at that level

by three of the executive positions examined.

Differences across industry groups

• Respondents across all industry groups perceive the

overall magnitude and severity of risks in the environment

to be higher for 2023 relative to 2022, and most perceive

2023 risks as higher than two years ago (2021).

• There is a marked contrast in perspectives across industry

groups about specific risk concerns, supporting the view

that industry context is important to consider. ",,1
1112,"And

within the top 10 risks, just two show a year-over-year

decline: uncertainty surrounding the core supply chain

and concerns about expectations among the workforce to

work remotely impacting the organization’s ability to retain

talent. In addition, whereas just one risk issue ranked at the

“Significant Impact” level in 2022, this year there are three

risk issues at that level, with the fourth falling just below 6.0.

Not surprisingly, supply chain concerns continue to

represent the top risk issues for board members and

executives in the industry group. In fact, two supply chain
related risk issues in the survey both land in the top five for

2023. Uncertainties surrounding the organization’s core

supply chain making it difficult to deliver products or services

at acceptable margins is the top risk issue, similar to 2022,

with uncertainties from reliance on international markets for

key elements of the supply chain (as noted earlier, a new risk

issue to this year’s survey) also in the top five.

Pandemic-driven supply chain issues have been well

documented. ",,1
1113,"“Future battlefields”
and methods of confrontation are expanding,
encompassing the land, sea, air, cyberspace
and outer space (explored in the Crowding and
Competition in Space Chapter in last year’s Global
Risks Report).61 Anti-satellite and hypersonic weapon
capabilities have already been demonstrated by

some states.62 Directed Energy Weapons are
expected to make significant progress over the
next decade, with the potential to disable satellites,
electronics, communications and positioning
systems, and some of these weapons may be more
cost-effective than traditional munitions.63 Quantum
computing may be harnessed to identify new
materials for use in stealth technologies, and cyber
and information warfare will be deployed to target
vulnerabilities in increasingly sophisticated military
technologies, which could range from disinformation
campaigns to hacking hardware in nuclear defence
systems.64

Importantly, these technologies are emerging in
parallel – with the potential for simultaneous and
compounding impacts on global security.65 The
testing and demonstration of enhanced capabilities
could destabilize geopolitical relationships and
accelerate an arms race, even in the absence of
triggering conventional or nuclear strikes. ",,0

IT Governance

Risk Definition

IT governance risks relate to challenges around oversight and management of IT systems

and resources. As organizations’ technology use has grown rapidly and continues to

expand, organizations face risks that policies and procedures will fail to scale and keep

pace with changes. A major new development is the rollout of ChatGPT, an open-access

generative AI chatbot, which employees could use to generate code or textual content, or

even to accelerate decision making. Third-party IT service providers are also a growing

concern for organizations, with potential exposure to cybersecurity and data privacy risks

via third parties.

Driver 1: New Frontiers in AI

ChatGPT has received a lot of attention since developer OpenAI made it freely available in

a research trial in November 2022. The underlying generative AI technology based on

large language models has been a research and development priority at many firms, and

competitor bots such as Google’s Bard and Baidu’s Ernie have also been announced. 19,20

Risks for audit to consider with ChatGPT, and generative AI in general, fall into three broad

categories: decentralized employee usage, unintended consequences of incorporation into

business processes and use by malicious actors (see Table 2).

",,0
1115,"For instance, according

to the UK-based Sustainability Hospitality Alliance, which

consists of large and small hotel companies worldwide, its

members have collectively committed to reduce carbon

emissions by 66% per room by 2030 and by 90% per room

by 2050.7

More than ever, consumers care deeply about how

companies stand on social, sustainability and regulatory

matters, which means that leading hospitality brands need

to reexamine their purpose and value and make decisions

that resonate with target consumers. ESG initiatives should

be viewed as future-proofing the organization; not merely

a task of reporting the status quo or checking a box, but a

mission to change outcomes.

Airline industry

While 2022 demand has already eclipsed pre-pandemic

levels, several lingering effects remain and continue to

threaten the ability of airlines to meet operational targets.

Among the biggest threats are labor issues and disruptions

impacting the reliability of airline flight schedules.

At the height of the pandemic, airlines offered early

retirement packages to pilots. ",,0

Nat cat falls three positions, overshadowed by seemingly more pressing
developments on the risk landscape, but there is no room for complacency,
as events in 2022 showed single events continue to cause losses in the billions
of dollars.

“This year’s lower ranking for nat cat illustrates how it
can recede from public awareness when other events
dominate the headlines, as it can be influenced by longerterm processes such as climate change,” says Mabé
Villar Vega, Catastrophe Risk Research Analyst at
AGCS. “It is important for it to stay high on companies’
risk agendas, with business continuity plans remaining
updated and tested, even in times of economic or
geopolitical turbulence.”

Villar Vega notes nat cat remains in the top three risks
for Asia Pacific while climate change is a top four risk
in Africa/Middle East: “These regions are frequently
exposed to different types of natural catastrophe,
including meteorological, geophysical, climatological and
hydrological. “However, they suffer a large ‘protection
gap’ – the difference between total and insured losses. ",,1
1117,"Trust in the army and police to handle future crises has increased among both experts
(64% to 69%) and the general public (62% to 64%), likely reflecting the rise in concern about
issues such as terrorism, geopolitical tensions and social discontent.

Public trust in experts
and governments has fallen
in the last year

Geopolitical tensions,
the erosion of certain fundamental
principles of international law
and their direct consequences
on energy security are raising
doubts about the ability of various
players to maintain the same level
of ambition in terms of action
against climate change. Yet this

1118,"And that was before Xi cemented

his position as modern-day emperor. Now that all Chinese
policy flows directly from a single all-powerful leader,
there’s even less transparency on the decision-making
process, less information flowing to the top, and less room
to admit error, course correct, or compromise.

We see risks in three areas this year, all stemming from
Maximum Xi.

First, the ill effects of centralized decision-making on
public health are now on display. Just weeks ago, Xi ended
the zero-Covid policy in the same arbitrary manner that he
implemented it more than two years ago. His snap decision
to lift all restrictions and let the virus spread unchecked
despite low elderly vaccination rates, without warning
citizens and local governments, and absent sufficient
preparations to cope with the resulting outbreaks will all
but ensure that more than one million Chinese people will
die, many unnecessarily (though most will not be reported).
Only a leader with unchallenged power could execute such
an extraordinary—and extraordinarily costly—reversal.

Moreover, if a severe new strain of Covid were to emerge,
Maximum Xi makes it more likely that it would spread
widely in China and beyond. ",,0

Space Risk in
Lower Earth
Orbit
(New risk)

Lower Earth Orbit (LEO) is a critical space resource on which many aspects of our current way of life

depends. Global communications systems - including satellite broadband coverage, Earth observation

systems including satellite imagery and weather forecasting, and global positioning systems all rely on

satellite infrastructure in LEO. The current expansion in the deployment of satellite mega-constellations in

Lower Earth Orbit (LEO) by commercial space companies such as Space X and OneWeb has the potential

to significantly increase the number of objects in orbit around the Earth. Such new infrastructure is adding

to existing space debris that has been accumulating from old space missions, such as rocket-debris and

non-operational satellites, of which only a tiny proportion is large enough to be tracked. There are numerous

risks to be aware of in this rapidly changing environment with potential impacts for re/insurers. ",,1
1120,"We aim to work with
clients that are “transition leaders” – that is,
traditional energy suppliers making
significant investments in alternatives, and
new energy suppliers bringing alternative
technology.

To understand their transition plans and
make sure they are aligned with our CSR
goals, we are using a proprietary framework
based on a number of science-based
metrics. But as the energy transition
challenge is industry-wide, we are also
engaging with the wider energy marketplace
to help raise the bar across the sector
and support our clients on this journey.

What are the underwriting
challenges?

L. B.: Much of the technology and many of
the processes needed to secure the energy
transition are still at the prototype stage,
which poses a challenge for underwriters:
there’s no loss experience and data on
which to base decisions.
We and the rest of the industry will continue
to rely on our underwriting expertise and
on experts from the energy sector to help us
to underwrite these new and developing
technologies. ",,0
1121,"The respondents said they are concerned

about potential increases in labor costs affecting their

organizations’ opportunity to meet profitability targets. At

the same time, the survey respondents point to succession

challenges and the ability to attract and retain top talent

as another major threat to meeting operational targets in

2023 — this is the seventh-ranked risk.

Clearly, with rising inflation and the prospect of a recession,

many large companies are taking a cautionary approach

with hiring. Amazon, for instance, recently announced it

will reduce its workforce by as many as 10,000 people,

according to some reports, as it prepares for a slower

growth period.6

While retailers are retrenching as online shopping slows and

consumers return to physical stores, some smaller companies

that have struggled with hiring in recent years are rolling

out perks to attract employees, especially seasonal holiday

workers. Rising inflation and the prospect of a recession mean

more companies are likely to be cautious with hiring and will

need to prepare to do more with fewer workers.

This is a good time for companies to develop a differentiated

employee experience and revisit their talent strategy to

ensure it aligns with their strategic business objectives. ",,0

Introduction
The level of uncertainty in today’s global marketplace and

the velocity of change continue to produce a multitude of

potential risks that can disrupt an organization’s business

model and strategy on very short notice. Unfolding events

in Eastern Europe, changes in government leadership in

several countries around the globe, escalating inflation,

rising interest rates, ever-present cyber threats,

competition for talent and specialized skill sets, continued

disruptions in global supply chains, rapidly developing

technologies … these represent just a sampling of the

complex web of drivers of risks that may threaten an

organization’s achievement of its objectives. Uncertainty

and risk are here to stay. Keeping abreast of emerging risk

issues and market opportunities is critical to improving

organizational resilience.

The need for robust, strategic approaches to anticipating

and managing risks cannot be over-emphasized. Boards of

directors and executive management teams who choose to

manage risks on a reactive basis are likely to be left behind

those who embrace the reality that risk and return are

interconnected and recognize the benefits of proactively

managing risks through a strategic lens. ",,0
1123,"Privacy will
strongly influence these agreements: the US
government recently committed to heightened
safeguards for transatlantic data flows, including
from US intelligence activities.112

However, many of these data sets may still be
subject to the threat of re-identification, even
with recent developments in privacy-enhancing
technologies such as synthetic data, federated
learning and differential privacy.113 Research
suggests that sensitive databases and technologies,
such as pools of biological data and DNA
sequencing, are already vulnerable to attack.114
Sensitive health data is governed inconsistently
and the creation of large pools of personal data
are creating lucrative targets for cybercriminals,
particularly given the less stable geopolitical
environment and limited norms currently governing
cyberwarfare. The potential consequences of the
large-scale theft of biometric or genomic information
are largely unknown but may allow for targeted
bioweaponry.

Acting today

At a national level, a patchwork of fragmented data
policy regimes at local or state levels raises the risk
of accidental and intentional abuses of data in a
manner that was not considered by the individual’s
original consent. Harmonizing policies at a national

level will enable more effective, less complicated
cross-border data-sharing mechanisms to power
innovation while still ensuring adequate protection
for individuals.

",,0
1124,"The rise of social
enterprises in the past decade is just one
indication of that shift in priorities. While
internal auditors ranked human capital as
the second biggest risk their organisations
faced in this year’s Risk in Focus 2023
survey, the organisational culture that
could help attract new talent only ranked
in eleventh place.

In fact, there is a gap between how people
at different seniority levels in organisations
perceive their relationship with the
business, according to a study by the
consultant McKinsey, which could suggest
why human capital and organisational
culture may sometimes be considered as
separate issues. While 85% of executives
and upper managers agreed that they
could live the purpose of the organisation
in their day-to-day lives, only 15% of
frontline managers and employees agreed.

Defining normal
working practices
John Devine, risk committee chair for
abrdn, says that organisations need to
understand when they are coming out of
the crisis and what it means to normalise
working practices. In his experience, such
events accelerate and force change – and
successful organisations are quick to
adapt. ",,0
1125,"Ineffectiveness of multilateral
institutions and international cooperation

Ineffectiveness of international cooperation mechanisms due to a weakening of global multilateral institutions

or marked geopolitical fragmentation. Includes, but is not limited to processes that underpin coordination on:

finance, the environment, humanitarian aid, health pandemics and trade.

Interstate conflict Belligerent bilateral or multilateral conflict between states manifesting as cyber attacks, proxy wars or hot war.

State collapse or severe instability Collapse of a state with geopolitical significance due to the erosion of institutions and rule of law, internal civil

unrest and military coups, or the effects of severe regional or global instability.

Terrorist attacks Large-scale or persistent small-scale terrorist attacks carried out by non-state actors with ideological, political

or religious goals, resulting in loss of life, severe injury or material damage caused by biological, chemical,

nuclear or radiological weapons or other means.

Use of weapons of mass destruction Deployment of biological, chemical, cyber, nuclear, radiological or autonomous AI weapons, resulting in loss of

life, destruction and/or international crises.

Chronic diseases and health conditions Widescale increase in chronic physical health conditions. ",,0
1126,"“Strikes, riots and civil commotion (SRCC) have a combined
score of 69% (see graphic), representing the real risk these
present to businesses,” Todorovic continues. “The last few
years have shown the huge impact a coordinated violent
SRCC event can have on an economy and politics, such as
the Black Lives Matter protests in the US and South Africa
Zuma riots of 2021.”

Industries at risk – particularly government departments,
industry, and the retail, transport and mining sectors –
should monitor local activity carefully and identify their
supply chain vulnerabilities. They should then review their
insurance policies and update business contingency plans
as necessary.

Potential flashpoints in 2023 will include countries with
polarized politics and those holding elections, says
Todorovic. “As inflationary frustrations grow, I expect a
number of SRCC incidents to occur on most continents,
based on economic, ethnic and political grounds.”

one risk overall for both 2023 and 2032 pertains to the

ability to attract and retain top talent in a tightening

labor market and succession challenges. Globally, this is

the only risk issue at the “Significant Impact” level.

• Future of work continues to be a defining business

challenge. The state of labor markets and the expected

adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), automation in all

its forms and other technologies are such that significant

efforts will be necessary to upskill and reskill existing

employees over the next decade. This is the seventh- and

second-rated risk, respectively, for 2023 and 2032.

• Rising labor costs are an elevated concern. The risk

of anticipated increases in labor costs affecting the

organization’s ability to meet profitability targets was

the third-rated risk for 2023, up from sixth in 2022. With

companies struggling to fill open positions and inflation

running hot, this issue has the potential to be stubbornly

persistent. Interestingly, it is the 10th-rated risk for 2032.

Conclusion and next steps
Addressing the growing risks for tech companies while controlling costs during an economic slowdown will require
risk departments to be grounded in basic risk management tactics while also embracing alternative solutions.
Following are 10 recommendations for successful technology risk management in 2023.

Conduct continuous risk assessments
As noted in Figure 4, the vast majority of respondents say
their companies are growing in innovative ways in 2023.
New products and new partnerships create new risks. As
tech companies make big bets and move quickly to grow, risk
management departments must constantly assess how these
moves impact risk profiles.

1132,"A looming investment shortfall

Even in the absence of a global crisis, the 1980s
“lost decade” of development in Latin America and
Sub-Saharan Africa provides a very real example of
the economic and humanitarian crisis that can arise
from a sovereign debt default, including currency
free falls, collapses in output, cost-of-living crises
and rapid increases in poverty. The 41 countries
that defaulted on their debt in the first half of the
decade required eight years, on average, to reach
their pre-crisis GDP per capita.136 Debt distress and
restructuring will also have an impact on investment.
According to GRPS results, the risk of Debt crises
drops in perceived severity over the longer-term
time frame, but the Collapse or lack of public
infrastructure and services becomes more severe.
The ability to finance continued productivity and
resilience will be hampered by economic and political
dynamics on both a global and national level.

Advanced economies will have more autonomy
to invest in future priorities, while developing
markets may be more beholden to the demands
of the creditor, meaning money could be diverted

from the areas of greatest social need, including
expenditure in public goods and infrastructure.
",,0
1133,"Given the prominent role
that many audit committees have in cybersecurity risk oversight,
the adoption of the latter requirement may impact audit committee
succession planning in 2023 and beyond.

Cybersecurity risks are not the only technology-driven risks that
may call for greater audit committee oversight in 2023. As the use
of artificial intelligence grows —and, with it, concerns about data
privacy, ethical implications of artificial intelligence, and other
matters— audit committees will be expected to address associated
risks, in some cases including areas for which the audit committee
may have primary responsibility.

Additional risks associated with technology include the possibility
that a line of business—possibly the principal line of business in
which the company engages—will be subject to disruption by a new
technology and risks that can result from unethical practices in the
use of artificial intelligence.

Environmental and climate change
While audit committees may not have primary responsibility
for overseeing risks associated with climate change and other
environmental matters—the Audit Committee Practices Report
indicates that only 34% of the companies surveyed allocate this
responsibility to their audit committees—they have significant
responsibility for evaluating disclosures and controls relating to
ESG issues. ",,0

In other cases, the insurance
industry has worked with
governments on innovative ways to
protect the public against emerging
threats. In the 1980s, for instance,
an increasing number of extreme
weather events that were not
covered by traditional insurance
policies led the French government

When the Great Fire of London
destroyed more than 13,000
buildings in 1666, it brought into
sharp focus the risk to property
from fire. The maritime insurers
responded to public concern by
branching out into fire insurance.
Over the centuries, the same
pattern has played out time and
again: a new form of uncertainty
arises, and the insurance industry
responds by developing new
products and services.

It is the role of insurers to protect
people from risks. Historically, when
new sources of uncertainty have
emerged, insurers have found

1136,"Operational risks dominate, with six of the top 10 risks for

2023 related to that category of risk, three of the top 10 risks

macroeconomic in nature and one risk strategic in nature.

Talent and culture concerns mostly dominate the operational

challenges. Executives and boards reveal challenges in

attracting and retaining talent as well as meeting the

expectations of an evolving workforce and shifting hybrid,

remote and in-person work environments to meet employee

expectations and needs. Flexibility has been the norm for

many organizations as they adjust to compete for different

types of talent, particularly those with digital and analytic

skillsets. Leaders also recognize how an ever-evolving

workforce may impact the culture of the organization. Five of

the six operational risks relate to talent and culture concerns:

• Concerns about succession challenges and the ability

to attract and retain talent continue to be significant

with it moving to the top risk position for 2023 from the

second highest-ranked risk for 2022, perhaps in response

to the continued numbers of individuals exiting the

workforce, leaving millions of jobs unfilled as part of the

so-called great resignation. ",,0
1137,"Engage in marketing diligence
Pay attention to real-time market insights, not just annual
or even quarterly reports, to better understand what is
happening in the insurance market. As your company
develops new products and solutions, be ready to
understand the costs and budgets for mitigating the risks.

Truly entertain alternative structures
For several years, some technology companies have been
considering alternative risk transfer solutions, reviewing
captives and thinking about integrated or structured
programs. Only about one-third of respondents to this year’s
study reported that they are trying to go beyond traditional
risk transfer programs. 2023 should be the year that
technology companies get more serious about developing
the foundation that allows alternative risk solutions to
become a viable option.

Market your program strategically
While there have been improvements in the cyber market,
especially for good risks, some clients are still facing
challenges obtaining a quote. Marsh data show that
cyber underwriters provided a quote for 84% of requests
made in 2020; this dropped to 64% in 2022. Yet, only 45%
of respondents said their companies are aggressively
marketing their insurance programs. ",1.0,0
1138,"Addressing the erosion of trust in multilateral
processes will enhance our collective ability to
prevent and respond to emerging cross-border
crises and strengthen the guardrails we have in
place to address well-established risks. In addition,

leveraging the interconnectivity between global
risks can broaden the impact of risk mitigation
activities – shoring up resilience in one area can
have a multiplier effect on overall preparedness for
other related risks. As a deteriorating economic
outlook brings tougher trade-offs for governments
facing competing social, environmental and security
concerns, investment in resilience must focus on
solutions that address multiple risks, such as funding
of adaptation measures that come with climate
mitigation co-benefits, or investment in areas that
strengthen human capital and development.

Some of the risks described in this year’s report are
close to a tipping point. This is the moment to act
collectively, decisively and with a long-term lens to
shape a pathway to a more positive, inclusive and

in the Allianz Risk Barometer for the first time.

The skyrocketing cost of energy has forced some
energy-intensive industries to use energy more
efficiently, move production to alternative locations
or even consider temporary shutdowns. The resulting
shortages threaten to cause supply disruption across a
number of critical industries in Europe, including food,
agriculture, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, construction
and manufacturing. The results show that companies in

gas, are much more concerned about the impact of the
crisis than elsewhere in the world, given its resulting

Energy crisis fallout

As well as ranking as the fourth top risk globally, the
energy crisis is the second most concerning cause of
interruption (35%) for companies, given its potential to
cause further widespread disruption. The skyrocketing
cost of energy has forced some energy-intensive industries
to temporarily cut production, find energy efficiencies,
or move production to alternative locations. The
resulting shortages threaten to cause supply disruption
across a number of critical industries, including food,
agriculture, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, construction and
manufacturing, forcing companies to seek alternatives or
cheaper sources of ingredients and raw materials.

Some industries, such as chemicals, fertilizers, glass, and
aluminum manufacturing, can be reliant on a single source
of energy – Russian gas in the case of many European
countries – and are therefore vulnerable to disruption to
energy supply or price increases.

“Because the energy crisis is affecting upstream energyintensive industries, the repercussions are also felt
further down the value chain,” says Grammatika. ",,1
1153,"So central banks are now caught between a rock and a

hard place: if they tighten too aggressively they risk pushing the economy into recession. But if they act too

slowly, inflation expectations could de-anchor and set in motion a self-fulfilling wage-price-spiral. This poses

a variety of risks for insurers. While higher inflation increases premium income, it also increases claims and

reserves for long-tail businesses. Higher interest rates reduce the net present value of liabilities. However,

this effect is – at least in part – offset by the declining value of fixed income assets (which constitute the

largest share of investments). A sudden increase in real interest rates could lead to higher credit risk of

corporates and sovereigns and trigger cancelations of annuities (rising lapse rates).

Passive
Investments

The rising share of retail participation in capital markets has boosted passive investment management

(where assets are not selected based on individual criteria but index attributes) which poses risks to

the stability and functioning of markets. In particular, market volatility could increase and shareholder

accountability decline (with negative implications for corporate governance). Competition could also be

harmed as a result of the growing concentration of ownership of companies.

Embrace “secure by design” principles
In the digital age, security, trust, and resilience are inseparable.
Businesses cannot achieve one without the others. That’s why
“secure by design” is a critical element of many successful digital
transformations. At its heart, “secure by design” is about
embedding security through every aspect of technology
development, from architecture to design to implementation. This
approach helps enhance the overall security of systems, products,
and services while also reducing overall costs, as companies do
not need to layer on new technology later that was not
contemplated up-front. It also ensures security is not approached
as a one-and-done capability. Only by making security part of the
core organizational DNA can enterprises stay ahead of ever

Evolving sector considerations in 2023
A recent record of industry resilience despite challenges
As the global telecoms industry enters 2023, it can be heartened by the resilience it has shown amid the recent
geopolitical and economic turbulence. In the past two years, telcos have been supported by a combination of price
increases, inorganic growth and government intervention. These factors have helped share prices across the global
sector broadly recover from their lows during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic — although the rebound
remains gradual and uneven.

Company strategies are being refreshed to surmount a volatile operating environment. Telcos’ digital transformation
initiatives are expanding in scope and ambition. And sustainability is re-emerging as a major focus at the board level
while workforce considerations are being shaped more than ever by the drive to improve diversity and inclusion (D&I)
and attract new talent.

The industry is also undergoing far-reaching network modernization in both fixed and mobile segments. To date,
the capex burden has been mounting, but some markets are likely to witness lower capital intensity in mobile going
forward as nationwide rollouts of 5G pass their peak.

scanning and scenario planning are useful tools
that can examine and build on “weak signals” in
qualitative and quantitative data sources to better
anticipate emerging trends. Established methods
can help crystallize expert disagreements,1 while a
greater distinction between risk and uncertainty –
imperfect knowledge, such that likelihood cannot be
scientifically quantified or known – will help challenge
core assumptions. Greater levels of uncertainty
should shift the focus from the probable to the
possible: the study of potential outcomes needs
to be expanded to ensure that risk mitigation and
preparedness addresses the full scope of possible
impacts.2 This is then complemented by risk
monitoring, which focuses on providing early warning
for when specific risks are about to materialize to
enable advanced preparedness measures.

Another step to enhance risk foresight is to explore
dynamics of change, to map interconnections
between risks, including dependencies between
critical systems. More sophisticated methods
of analyzing interconnected risks (beyond linear
relationships) can support the evaluation and
prioritization of risk resources. ",,0

persist in the industry group for the foreseeable future.

Underscoring this point, as noted below, challenges with

the ability to attract and retain top talent is the top-ranked

risk issue for the industry group in 2032.

A number of critical risk issues fall just below the top

five but remain highly relevant, one of which is the risk

of not being sufficiently resilient or agile to manage

an unexpected crisis. Manufacturing and distribution

organizations have experienced successive waves of

uncertainty over the last several years. While these events

have elevated organizational resiliency, they also have

fostered an environment of constant change that has

created fatigue among management and employees alike.

Being “agile” is not just related to the IT organization and

environment, but also whether the organization is truly

“business agile” as a way to respond to significant events

proactively versus reactively.

obvious is that the risk of damage to operational systems due to collisions (with space debris, other

operational systems or meteorites) is vastly increased as their numbers increase. Furthermore, current

thousands of additional operational satellites in LEO. However, there are wider risks relating to the potential

for cyber-attacks on connected satellite constellations impacting critical infrastructure on Earth, geopolitical

tensions created as a small number of companies and countries dominate this critical and finite resource,

and environmental impacts on Earth resulting from the greater number of rocket launches needed to

develop mega-constellations and issues related to the regulations/practices adopted relating to the

decommissioning of satellites and the consequences of space debris that falls to Earth.

layoffs reflect a similar pattern, such as toy maker Hasbro, which saw a surge in demand

for board games during the pandemic. 5 Tech layoffs have been significant in scale, but it

remains unclear to what degree they will be mirrored in other sectors. While Dow recently

it became clear to both businesses and

ability to maintain a helicopter view of

people to make mistakes and try new things
without fear of failure can also help develop

First, between the exit from zero Covid, domestic unrest, and a challenging economic outlook, Xi has bigger fish to fry

Second, Xi’s main retaliatory options—export controls on rare earth minerals, restrictions on semiconductor packaging
for Western firms, unlinked economic measures—would damage China’s own economy at a time of historically weak
growth.

Third, China is hundreds of billions of dollars and a minimum of three to five years away from being able to produce
the chips it needs domestically. Its dependence on older-generation semiconductors from TSMC, which are excluded
from US export restrictions, will only increase in the meantime.

And fourth, Xi doesn’t see the US moves as a step-change escalation. After all, China has been intent on achieving
technological leadership and self-reliance for years. Export controls are considered fair game given Beijing’s
longstanding policies—for example, Made in China 2025 and “dual circulation”.

3 Weapons of mass disruption
When the Berlin Wall came down, the United States was the world’s principal exporter of democracy.
Not always consistently and not always with positive results, but no other country came close. For
most of the time since, technological innovation (much of which took place in America) has been
a liberalizing force. But today, the US has become the principal exporter of tools that undermine
democracy—not intentionally, but nonetheless as a direct consequence of the business models
driving growth. Resulting technological advances in artificial intelligence (AI) will erode social
trust, empower demagogues and authoritarians, and disrupt businesses and markets.

Focusing on
strategic data risk
When the root cause is data, Humayun
says, risk can manifest in many areas at
the same time, including for example,
reputational, regulatory, operational,
financial and other risks. But unlike
emerging systemic risks, businesses are
in the fortunate position of being able
to control the situation with the right
focus and prioritisation.

For Lloyds Banking Group, the importance
of focusing on data was highlighted
when the Group added data risk to its
risk taxonomy a few years back. Sorting
out the source data can mitigate risks in
multiple areas of the organisation where
the risk manifests itself in various forms.
",1.0,0
1189,"Still, the pandemic’s
impact, and acceleration effect on major preexisting trends, were felt acutely across the
industry. Significant growth in demand for mobile
connectivity, digital service consumption, and
digital business transformation all brought unique
opportunities and challenges in 2021.

In a dynamic regulatory, technological, and
competitive environment, telecoms continually
adjust strategies and operations to match
emerging trends. Developing robust network
infrastructure combined with innovative, valueadding services and solutions remains core to
meeting evolving customer preferences and
generating new revenue streams.
",,0
1190,"CHROs are the most

concerned group, ranking all risks as “Significant Impact.”

In relation to our prior year results, while most executives

rated fewer specific risk issues as “Significant Impact,”

board members increased their “Significant Impact”

risks from zero in 2022 to four in 2023. Other groups

report more significant declines in these risks after the

heightened concern over the two previous years. CEOs

report five risks at the highest impact level, which is

down from 13 in 2022, and “Significant Impact” risks

for CIOs/CTOs decreased from 17 to six. Somewhat

surprisingly, CROs report 10 risks as “Less Significant

Impact,” an increase from six in 2022. CIOs/CTOs also

report eight risks as “Less Significant Impact.” Clearly,

there are noticeable differences in views about 2023

risk conditions across executive type. The disparity of

perspectives among executives and directors begs for

more engagement in conversations with one another to

forge a robust view of the organization’s risk profile.

2032 risk issues

For 2032, overall risk perceptions exhibit significant

variation relative to 2023. CHROs, CROs, CAEs and Other

C-Suite executives have the most concern about the future,

rating eight or more risks at the “Significant Impact” level.

",,0
1191,"At the same time, geopolitical dynamics have turned
the natural resource crisis from one of affordability
to one of availability (x-axis), creating a cascading
economic, environmental and humanitarian crisis in
all but a handful of select countries – but even these
remain exposed through cross-border effects. In this
future, the resulting socioeconomic fall-out exceeds
the scope and scale of all other futures, and state
intervention turns even more aggressive, expanding
beyond economic confrontation to secure supply of
necessities for populations.

Building on Resource constraints, both affordability
and availability concerns are widening inequality.
Reflecting Resource competition, self-sufficient
sources of food production have been scaled
up, but with limited sharing of innovation and
financing, the tipping point of overall productivity
growth in agriculture has already passed. Without

communities and countries have resorted to changes
in crop choice and large shifts in land-use patterns to
maintain current production growth.33 Agriculture has

GETTY
Risks and threats can be forerunners to crisis situations for companies and organizations. An informal survey of CEOs, advertising, and other executives and experts yielded what they thought are the most significant dangers businesses will face this year.
Recession
“The biggest and most obvious threat to companies and organizations in 2023 is the global rise of inflation and subsequent economic downturn,” Richard Osborne, founder and CEO of UK Business Forums, said via email.
“Recession is the word on everyone’s lips heading into 2023. While profiting during a period of high inflation isn’t completely impossible, it’s far from ideal when consumers have less purchasing power. The value of a currency is only as high as the number of goods or services that one unit of money can buy,” he noted.

1196,"In the United States, for

example, a new federal privacy legislation, the American

Data Privacy and Protection Act, is making its way through

Congress and has bipartisan support.8

There is also the stringent new Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy

framework, which the United States and the European Union

(EU) agreed to in 2022, that addresses data privacy and

protection of EU citizens’ data.9 The Digital Services Act, which

the European Council signed into law in September 2022, aims

to protect the digital space against the spread of illegal content

and carries significant financial penalties and enforcement

actions against infringing companies.10 The EU’s Artificial

Intelligence Act is another one; deemed the first legislation

globally that aims to regulate the use of AI across all sectors,

it proposes state-of-the-art security and privacy-preserving

requirements for companies developing high-risk AI systems.11

Digital disruptions

Many TMT leaders fear their organizations may not have

the right skills to take advantage of emerging digital

technologies, especially during this period of economic

instability, high inflation and talent shortages.

This explains the fourth-ranked risk for 2023, which

concerns the adoption of digital technologies (e.g.",1.0,0
1197,"More protests were observed between January
and October than in all of 2021.45

Consequences of societal polarization are vast,
ranging from a drag on growth to civil unrest and
deepening political fissures. And there are indications
that increasing polarization is contributing to the
decline of democracies and accompanying rise
in hybrid regimes, with the share of the world’s
population living in autocratizing countries rising
from 5% in 2011, to 36% in 2021. Only 13% of
the world’s population are currently living under a
liberal democracy, compared to 44% living under an
electoral autocracy.46

The erosion of the social and political centre risks
becoming self-perpetuating. Divisions incentivize
the adoption of short-term, more extreme policy
platforms to galvanize one side of the population
and perpetuate populist beliefs. Notably, the
contest between two, non-centrist candidates or
positions is often close.47 Although heralded as
a resurgence of leftist movements, the Brazilian
presidential election of 2022 was won by President
Lula by 1.8 points – the slimmest margin recorded
since it became a democratic nation.48 As such, a
large proportion of the population can feel alienated
and angered by leadership in the following term,
acting as a multiplier to existing societal concerns
and civil unrest. ",,0
1198,"Foreign aid and foreign direct investment, such as the large development

and infrastructure loans associated with China’s Belt and Road Initiative, could continue to

be used by both parties as mechanisms to extend their influence. 59 These activities could

impact the business landscape insofar as either actor gains leverage to steer other

countries’ trade and economic policies toward their interests.

Driver 2: Economic Crosscurrents and Mixed Signals

Current macroeconomic conditions across the globe are creating a tough decision-making

environment for organizations. Economic indicators portray a confusing situation of

cross-cutting pressures, such that traditional models of the business cycle give limited

insight. Organizations may see significant disruption in sales, revenue and financial

markets as actors change their behavior to align with current conditions and incentives.

Inflation and the responses to it present one set of challenges. Overall rates of inflation

have been persistent, despite central banks aggressively hiking interest rates. However,

inflation may be slowing based on price indicators, falling to rates of 6.4% annually in the

U.S. and 8.5% annually in the eurozone for January 2023. ",,0
1199,"That risk is rated as a “Significant Impact” risk

by all industry groups except the one noted and Financial

Services; however, Financial Services rated the economy

as the third-highest risk overall. (To no surprise,

interest rate risk was this industry group's top risk.)The

Consumer Products and Services, Manufacturing and

Distribution, and Healthcare industry groups also rate

the risk related to anticipated increases in labor costs at

the “Significant Impact” level. In addition, the Consumer

Products and Services, Technology, Media and

Telecommunications, and Healthcare industry groups

rate succession planning as a “Significant Impact” risk.

• The top risk for 2023 and a decade later for the Energy

and Utilities industry group relates to how rising threats

associated with catastrophic natural disasters and

weather phenomena may create significant operational

challenges. No other industry group includes that

risk in their top five risk concerns. Interestingly, while

respondents in the Energy and Utilities industry group

do not rate that risk at the “Significant Impact” level for

the short term (2023), they do rate it at the “Significant

Impact” level for the long term (2032).

1205,"For a publicly funded organisation
such as the World Intellectual Property
Organisation (WIPO) attracting, training
and retaining qualified data scientists and
IT auditors is a struggle, Rajesh Singh,
director of its internal oversight division,
says. Singh’s operation includes three
elements – evaluation, investigation
and pure internal audit. The internal
audit team has three people and is being
boosted by a data scientist and a full-time,
mid-grade audit member with IT auditing
expertise. But because the internal audit
section is small, people tend to leave after
two or three years as there are few options
for promotion, even though WIPO invests
heavily in training. Second line functions
in the organisation suffer from the same
issue for staff with IT expertise.

HUMAN CAPITAL, DIVERSITY
AND TALENT MANAGEMENT

“The more we invest in boosting their
skills, the more we risk losing them to
organisations with deeper pockets,”
Singh says. “It creates a loss of institutional
knowledge that is hard to rebuild because
turnover is relatively fast.” Like many chief
audit executives, he partners with thirdparty suppliers, but a single assignment
sometimes can cost the same as an IT
auditor’s annual salary, which he finds
hard to stomach.

",,0
1206,"Enterprise resource planning (ERP) software
is a place to start; businesses should work to ensure that these
systems have end-to-end visibility and can generate the reports to
satisfy disclosure requirements for each relevant jurisdiction.

Tracking environmental and social impacts is another element for
tech companies to focus on in the coming year. While consensus has
yet to be reached on standards and metrics, reputable ERP vendors
and industry groups have frameworks that may satisfy anticipated
requirements. Compliance with evolving regulations may feel like
a moving target, but companies may achieve success working by
analogy (likening a new business practice or transaction type to an
existing guideline) and documenting practices meticulously.

2023 technology industry outlook

Strategic questions to consider:

• How can we ensure we have a
clear view of operations across the
enterprise and the value chain?

• What reports and outputs will we
need to achieve compliance with
new and evolving regulations?

• Will regulators require real-time
reporting and automated reports
with direct pulls from ERP software?
If so, how can we implement
these securely?

• To what extent is our tech
company responsible for
monitoring business practices
and impacts across partners,
suppliers, and service providers?

Figure B.2 presents the top five risks for each of the
121 economies surveyed.

Over 12,000 respondents were presented with the
following question: “Which five risks are the most
likely to pose the biggest threat to your country in
the next two years?” and were asked to select these
from a list of 35 risks.

“Risk 1” indicates the most frequently selected
risk in each economy. Tied risks are presented
in alphabetical order, with the tie indicated by
numbering. For example, in Angola, two risks (“Rapid
and/or sustained inflation” and “Employment and
livelihood crises”) are tied for first place and there is,
therefore, no risk listed in second place.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Top 3 experts rankings since 2018

/ AXA FUTURE RISKS REPORT 2022 5 / AXA FUTURE RISKS REPORT 2022
Experts’ top 10 risks include three economic risks
for the first time: financial instability risks, macro-economic
risks, and risk related to monetary and fiscal policy. Within these
risks inflation is a top concern for both experts and the general
public, many of whom are already facing struggles as their
purchasing power drops.

Persistent rises in energy and food prices – exacerbated by
shortages due to geopolitical turmoil – have the potential
to widen inequalities and fuel societal unrest, which ranks high
for experts in both the US (4th) and Europe (6th). Public authorities
will need to be alert to the need for action
to safeguard public cohesion.

Economic downturn

Last year’s edition of the Global Risks Report
warned that inflation, debt and interest rate rises
were emerging risks. Today, governments and
central banks – led by developed markets, notably
the United States of America, Eurozone and the
United Kingdom of Great Britain – are walking
a tightrope between managing inflation without
triggering a deep or prolonged recession, and
protecting citizens from a cost-of-living crisis while
servicing historically high debt loads. Public-sector
respondents to the GRPS ranked Debt crises (#6),
Failure to stabilise price trajectories (#8) and
“Prolonged economic downturn” (#10) in the top
10 risks over the next two years (Figure 1.3).

country grew significantly richer, and more than one billion people escaped extreme poverty
to join the ranks of history’s first global middle class, narrowing the opportunity gap between
developing and advanced industrialized nations. Human development indicators ranging
from infant mortality and life expectancy to education and women’s rights tell a story of nearly
uninterrupted improvement in living standards and quality of life around the world.

That progress has been thrown into reverse by three years of mutually reinforcing shocks, including the Covid-19
pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war, and the global inflation surge. The United Nations estimates that five years of human
development progress have been lost since Covid-19 hit, and the impact has been global: More than 90% of countries
experienced a decline in human development in 2020 or 2021. In 2023, billions of people will become more vulnerable
as more economic, security, and political gains are lost.

Inflation’s global shockwaves (please see risk #4) will take an especially heavy toll on vulnerable populations in developing
countries as rising prices, tighter financial conditions, and slowing global growth stoke public (and therefore political) anxiety.

and rerouting to Asia, who is likely to increase demand
(led by a rebounding Chinese economy). Winter could
drain Europe’s gas stocks and expensive liquefied
natural gas (LNG) imports may not be enough to
absorb the shock. New LNG regasification terminals
will likely open in Europe, but they may compete with
growing demand in Asia, potentially keeping oil and
gas prices high.

As many nations look for energy stability, they are
temporarily shelving decarbonization goals, thus
exposing the essential role fossil fuels still play in
powering the global economy. Even before the war in
Ukraine, fossil fuels constituted 80 percent of total
energy supply with renewables accounting only for 3
percent (graphic below)1. Tensions between the
developed and the developing world caused by the
scramble for energy might also weaken climate policy.
Requests from emerging markets for financial support
and damage compensation from climate adaptation and
extreme weather events may fall on deaf ears as
developed countries focus on domestic energy needs to

Consider how the first and second lines of
responsibilities (based on the ‘Three Lines model’)
are identifying and assessing where these risks and
pressures are likely to impact the organization.
Internal Audit should also review third-party suppliers
exposed to economic shifts, and more broadly
consider the organization’s capital planning and
management, net interest margins, credit/default
risk and debt recovery, claims management and
business cases for future investments.

Internal Audit can also play a role in identifying and

that a robust framework is in place with appropriate
risk mitigation measures that can be applied on an

This generation is now coming of age, entering the
workforce and political life. Gen Z currently makes up
30% of the world’s population and is expected to comprise
27% of the global workforce by 2025. In the United States,
Gen Z turned out in record numbers for the 2022 midterm
elections, helping to hold off a Republican “red wave”
by breaking in favor of Democratic candidates in swing
states such as Pennsylvania and Michigan. And while its
power at the ballot box will only grow, Gen Z’s political
influence already extends further owing to its outsized
role in campaigns organized on social media.

Generational transitions often require corporations and
governments to make significant institutional, strategic,

and policy changes. When women entered the workforce
during World War II, businesses were required to develop
new workplace conditions better suited to childcare and
family obligations. In the 1960s, baby boomers ushered in

risk of unintended escalation, for example by limiting
the spillover of conflicts across domains, such as
a cyberattack on critical infrastructure escalating
into a targeted destructive exchange with lethal
autonomous weapons.83 Establishing norms will be
essential to ensuring the right balance is struck so
that technological innovation can continue to be
harnessed to improve socioeconomic outcomes for
humanity.

However, achieving effective arms control will
be even more challenging than in the past. It will
require engagement with a broader range of actors
– including academic researchers and the private
sector – given the dual-usages of many of these
technologies. Developments are quickly outpacing
global governance processes. An escalating
arms race will further hinder collaboration, but the
regulation of new weapons technologies to control
proliferation and usage can only be achieved through
transnational cooperation. The first step should
include greater recognition by global powers of
the strategically beneficial value to agreements on
key arms control issues. In the longer term, new
strategies for global governance that can adapt
to this new security context must be explored to
assuage the concerns of nations and avoid a spiral
of instability and accidental or intentional destruction.

Clearly, energy and utilities executives are worried that

unwilling to keep pace with technological change in the

from deploying advanced technologies effectively to create

sustainable competitive advantage, and to help drive

However, these leaders can take some comfort in knowing

that executives in other industries foresee similar

challenges for the future, as four of the top five risks for

1. In terms of the time and
effort spent on internal auditing
assignments, how is internal
audit aligned to the organisation’s
strategic objectives – including
on geopolitical risk and
climate change?

2. How strong is the support for
internal audit activities in areas
such as strategy and crisis
management and what can be
done to improve that support
where it is lacking?

3. How far is internal audit able to
leverage resources of other lines
to provide proper coverage and
minimise the duplication of effort?

1235,"At the same time, Tehran has
escalated its nuclear program in dramatic ways, all but ending any chance of reviving the
nuclear deal. And now Iran has wedded itself to Putin’s imperial ambitions in Ukraine. Facing
convulsions at home while lashing out abroad, this year will feature new confrontations
between the Islamic Republic and the West.

Led by young people and women, protests have spread across the country—creating the most serious popular threat to
the state since the revolution that brought the Islamic Republic to power in 1979. The demonstrations are explicitly antigovernment, with protesters calling for the fall of the clerical regime. In response, the authorities have killed more than
500 people, according to human rights groups. Tehran has ceded no ground on demands for meaningful reforms. Faced
with popular unrest, the state has shown that it lacks any capacity to respond except with repression.

The protests are leaderless, dispersed, and attract relatively small numbers—all factors that make them unlikely to
overthrow the Iranian regime. But they’ve also been remarkably persistent, with security services so far unable to crush
the protesters as they did in previous rounds of unrest. ",,0
1236,"The issues here are domestic,
with two points particularly noteworthy: The easing of
the strict zero-covid policy will stress-test the Chinese
economy, while the weakness of the (huge) real estate
sector remains a drag on consumer sentiment. As with the
zero-covid policy, the latter owes itself to erratic economic
policies that first allowed it to overheat and then brutally
slammed on the brakes.

The current situation is characterized by one peculiarity: all
three major economic areas – the US, China and Europe –
are in crisis at the same time, albeit for different reasons,
according to Allianz Research.

In Europe, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing
energy crisis are at the forefront: exploding energy prices
are driving inflation to ever new heights and “eating” into
the entire price structure. The result is falling real incomes
and corporate profits, with corresponding consequences
for consumption, production and investment. Restrictive
monetary policy to contain inflation expectations is rather
counterproductive in this situation, but without alternative.

1237,"“Inflation will affect business interruption exposures,
especially in sectors that derive revenues from
commodities or products that are seeing the biggest
inflationary impact,” says Pachov. “Conversely,
companies’ BI values may fall in sectors that are seeing
reduced demand or squeezed margins in a highinflation environment.”

The threat of recession is another likely source of disruption
in 2023, with potential for supplier failure and insolvency,
which is a particular concern for companies with single or
limited critical suppliers. According to Allianz Trade, global
business insolvencies are likely to rise significantly in 2023
(see Insolvency outlook on page 20).

“Recession and inflation are a big source of uncertainty for
companies, and a potential source of business interruption.
Following the pandemic, some companies ramped up
investment to meet the surge in demand. Now, if we see a
recession and there is no market they might be in trouble,
and this could have a huge impact in certain sectors, with a
risk of supplier insolvency,” says Pachov.

1238,"Now the cost-of-living crisis
has forced households to readjust their spending priorities.

EY research1 across several countries shows that six in ten households are worried
about future increases in broadband subscription prices. Meanwhile, nearly half
(45%) believe they overpay for content services, and a similar proportion (44%)
believe their broadband provider doesn’t do enough to direct them to the best deal.
With households planning to reduce spend, risks of churn and “spin down”
are increasing.

These threats are compounded by increasing pressure from regulators on behalf
of consumers — with some policy-makers demanding that telcos do more to offer
“social tariffs.” Meanwhile, operators in some markets are already linking price
increases to inflation rates. While this has historically helped justify price hikes,
customers are unlikely to welcome additional price increases in the current climate.

A further factor is that communicating offers of discounts or price savings can carry

respondents saying it was a top five risk
(the same as in 2022). It is also the area

internal auditors expect the risk to still rank
highest as a threat to their organisations
but with slightly fewer ranking it a top five

Supply chain risk emerged as a top five concern for energy

and utilities executives in our 2022 survey, and it remains

our previous survey report, the energy industry is especially

vulnerable to supply chain risk given that its value chain is

highly service-, feedstock-, parts- and equipment-oriented.

Many organizations run lean inventories as a strategy to

balance out operational costs. Increased globalization and

reliance on third parties are also contributing factors to

supply chain fragility for energy companies.

slow-burning risk: impacts are subtle, lagged and
cumulative in nature, but can be highly corrosive in
overall impact to the strength of human capital and
development – a critical mitigant to the impact and
likelihood of other global risks.

Acting today

In recognition of the risks posed to broader financial
stability, timely and deeper debt write-downs could
allow a faster return to developmental progress for
vulnerable countries and render a future default less
likely. The private sector could be incentivized to
participate in debt restructuring through a variety
of mechanisms, including issuing of new bonds
with stronger legal protections, loss reinstatement
commitments and value recovery instruments – with
the latter enabling private creditors to gain from
upside developments in debtor countries in the
future, such as GDP-linked instruments in Costa
Rica, Argentina, Greece and Ukraine.140

As a complementary mechanism to more
comprehensive debt restructuring, there may be

increased deployment of debt-for-development deals
(see Chapter 2.2: Natural ecosystems), particularly
relating to climate-positive adaptation, to help break
the correlation between exposure to climate change
and debt vulnerability.141 However, this should not
just be limited to environmental concerns. ",,1
1249,"Tech leaders are using other cost and efficiency levers, too, such
as revisiting procurement decisions, using digital tools to optimize
sourcing activities, reexamining operations from a tax perspective
to identify potential savings, and transforming operating models.9
According to Deloitte’s 2022 Global Intelligent Automation survey,
organizations are increasingly deploying intelligent automation
technologies—including RPA, optical character recognition, AI,
low-code tools, and process mining—to realize broad benefits that
include improved productivity, increased accuracy, better customer
experience, and cost reduction.10 Indeed, surveyed leaders whose
organizations have moved beyond piloting intelligent automation
reported achieving cost reductions of 32%, on average.11

Cloud computing and XaaS12 will likely continue to flourish during
economic uncertainty.13 Facing fluctuating IT demands and workforce
challenges, leaders accelerated the shift to service-based IT during
the pandemic.14 Researchers estimate that, as of 2022, cloud
represents 40% of global enterprise IT spending and as-a-service
represents a majority of software spending.15 The benefits—elastic
scaling of IT capacity and costs, increased agility, minimized risk,
and access to innovative capabilities—have heightened appeal in
uncertain times. Migrating operations to the cloud can also help
companies shift from capital expenditures to a consumption-based
model, freeing up cash for operations. ",,0

TEN RISK SCENARIOS THAT COULD RESHAPE THE GLOBAL ECONOMY

E IU produces a quantitative and qualitative assessment of economic, political and regulatory risks
that help our clients evaluate potential shifts in a country’s operating environment. In 2022 the

global repercussions of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine shifted global concerns away from coronavirusrelated health issues and towards growing political, security and macroeconomic risks. We expect that
ripple effects from the war in Ukraine, global monetary tightening and an economic slowdown in China
will weigh on the economy in 2023, with global growth slowing to only 1.6%. This white paper explores
some of the risks that could lead to even slower growth, or even, trigger a global recession.

inequality and lack of access to digital services”
and “Adverse outcomes of frontier technologies”
are also anticipated to significantly deteriorate over
the 10-year time frame.

The scores of multiple social risks are also worsening,
including “Severe mental health deterioration”,
“Collapse or lack of public infrastructure and
services”, and “Chronic diseases and health
conditions”. In contrast, economic risks such
as “Failure to stabilize price trajectories”, “A
prolonged economic downturn”, “Collapse of a
systemically important industry or supply chain”,
and “Asset bubble burst” are perceived to fall slightly
in expected severity over the 10-year time frame.

media, which increases polarization and distrust in
institutions alongside political engagement.49

“Misinformation and disinformation” are,
together, a potential accelerant to the erosion of
social cohesion as well as a consequence. With
the potential to destabilize trust in information and
political processes,50 it has become a prominent tool
for geopolitical agents to propagate extremist beliefs
and sway elections through social media echo

chambers. It was perceived as a moderately severe
risk by GRPS respondents, ranking 16th over the
short term. Regulatory constraints and educational
efforts will likely fail to keep pace, and its impact
will expand with the more widespread usage of
automation and machine-learning technologies,
from bots that imitate human-written text to
deepfakes of politicians.51

Polarization undermines social trust and, in some
cases, has reflected power struggles within a political
elite more than underlying divisions in ideologies.52
Often, hardened polarization on key issues lead to
government gridlocks. ""Swings"" between parties

longer-term policy outlook, causing greater strife,

Organizational Resilience

Organizations’ ability to withstand crises and disruptions may become more critical in 2023 amid increased
financial risk and volatility. Many organizations’ resilience-related processes are still largely limited to IT
disaster recovery, business continuity or operational risk.

• Forty-nine percent of CEOs see geopolitical instability as likely to disrupt business

strategies in the near future — higher than all other issues except inflation and

supply networks struggled, Deloitte urged tech leaders to evaluate
where and how manufacturing happens; to focus on improving
transparency, flexibility, and resiliency of their supply chains; and
to prepare proactively for future uncertainty and other systemic
risks.1 We recommended that tech companies ramp up innovation
and transformation by doubling down on cloud and everything-asa-service (XaaS).2 We advised leaders to bolster their talent bench in
critical capabilities such as artificial intelligence (AI), robotic process
automation (RPA), and cybersecurity.3

While many leaders appear to have heeded the advice, in 2023
the tech industry will likely continue to grapple with issues around
supply chains, workforce, and innovation—now exacerbated
by considerable macroeconomic and global uncertainties. A
recent Deloitte survey revealed technology decision-makers’ top
strategic concerns for the next two to three years: Macroeconomic
uncertainty topped the rankings, followed by workforce issues
and then the competitive landscape.4 Geopolitical and regulatory
uncertainties also worry the respondents, though not as intensely.

While tech stocks outperformed during the pandemic pressures
of 2020–2021, the sector led considerable stock market declines in
2022.5 A major challenge now for tech companies is how to weather

1281,"With consumer and

business confidence weakening, global growth will slow
from 6% in 2021 to about 3% in 2022 to less than 2% in
2023, with much of the world experiencing negative
growth. While the absence of financial imbalances of the
scale witnessed in 2008 or 2020 will limit the depth of the
downturn, without a boost from expansionary monetary
and fiscal policy, the recession will prove protracted.

One immediate effect of these economic troubles will
be pressure on incumbents in countries with elections
this year: Turkey, Spain, Argentina, Nigeria, and Poland.
But even countries where elections are not scheduled
will see greater risk of government turnover. And
where governments muddle through, popular pressure
for fiscally unsustainable policies in a tight financial
environment will exacerbate debt problems and could
trigger market instability—for example, in the UK, Italy,
Brazil, Colombia, and Hungary.

Rising interest rates and global recession will also raise the
risk of emerging-market crises. The nightmare scenario

Third parties
create weak links
While many large organisations are
relatively well-protected by strong cyber
defences and regular up-to-date training,
this year has seen more of a shift to hackers
targeting third-party suppliers with less
mature security systems. Yet European
legislation such as the General Data
Protection Regulation25 and, more recently,
guidance by the European Banking
Authority, place responsibility squarely
on the shoulders of the organisation that
owns the data26. This trend is likely to
continue to grow under Europe’s revised
cybersecurity directive, NIS227. Like many
new emerging risks, identification, control

1284,"“A number of claims
were caused by human errors in the first instance, but
these errors also occurred because of production pressures
and the hiring of third-party contractors to maintain works,
who may not have had the same expertise and knowledge
of the permanent workforce.”

Regularly assessing and updating prudent fire mitigation
practices, including preventative measures, fire
extinguishing methods and contingency planning, remain
essential for all businesses to lower the risk of loss from
an incident.

Fire risks are often well understood and typically well
risk managed. However, fire remains a significant cause
of business interruption (BI) and supply chain disruption,
especially where companies rely on third party suppliers
for critical components. Claims analysis by Allianz shows
that fire is the largest single cause of corporate insurance
losses, accounting for 21% of the value of 500,000+
insurance industry claims over the past five years
(equivalent to €18bn).

Aging property and infrastructure, such as in the energy
industry for example, is a worrying cause for fire and BIrelated losses, as is a lack of trained personnel.

attacks but increasingly we also see social engineering
scams and ‘deep fake’ attacks,” explains Sexton. “Smaller
companies can also be highly exposed to supply chain
attacks as they often purchase software program licenses
of much larger organizations or vendors.” Failure of digital
supply chains or cloud service platforms (35%) is the
third most important cyber risk concern for Allianz Risk
Barometer respondents.

Skill shortages and capacity issues

With all these challenges it is unsurprising that demand
for cyber security experts is growing. More and more
companies are looking to employ cyber security specialists,
but supply is not keeping up with demand. According
to Cybersecurity Ventures, the number of unfilled
cyber-security jobs worldwide grew 350% between
2013 and 2021 to 3.5 million6 – enough to fill 50 large
football stadiums.

At the same time, IT service providers and consulting firms
that conduct forensic examinations of cyber incidents and
restore systems are running out of capacity. In Germany,
The Federal Office for Information Security (BSI)7 has
warned of a “fundamental shortage” of personnel for
incident response services. For those who are available to

Decentralized Employee Usage

Just as students have been exploring the use of ChatGPT to cut corners on assignments,

employees are also finding ways to speed up workflows with help from the bot. ChatGPT

has a myriad of applications, ranging from generating textual content to helping

developers write and refine code. Employees may use ChatGPT without specific direction

or approval from management to cut down on workload or complete tasks more quickly.

To get useful content from ChatGPT, users must provide specific prompts and may

continue to go back and forth in a conversation to refine the results. Employees could

disclose confidential or proprietary information, which OpenAI can then retain and use to

train and improve the model. 21 Amazon’s legal department recently warned employees

A NEW NEXUS OF RISK

18 / AXA FUTURE RISKS REPORT 2022
Three of the top four risks ranked
by experts – climate change,
geopolitical instability and energy
risks – have become more deeply
interconnected in the last year.
After	the	Russian	invasion	of	Ukraine,
geopolitical risks and energy risks
have both shot up the rankings
in this year’s survey.
As the impacts of climate change
become ever more obvious, so does
the need to transition to low-carbon
energy sources. Meanwhile,
worsening geopolitical tensions are
raising doubts about the future ability
to	find	global	solutions	for	climate
change. ",,1

users reported their smartwatches/fitness trackers have improved
their fitness and health; the most common uses are to track daily
steps, pulse rate, calories and nutrition, heart health, and sleep.44
And 55% of device owners said they share wearable data with their
medical providers—leading the trend of health data integration and
improved monitoring of health conditions.45

Large cloud providers, for their part, are inking deals with hospitals
and health care systems as they compete for a share of the lucrative
health care cloud market.46 These projects typically involve moving
electronic health records (EHRs) and applications to the cloud, and
some focus on using data analytics and AI to develop predictive
insights that can help with scheduling, capacity planning, and

identifying patients who could benefit from early interventions.47
Next-gen EHRs could evolve into technology-enabled platform
ecosystems that interoperate with other data sources (e.g., from
wearables), leverage AI to support clinical decision-making, and
provide data and insights to public health departments and other
entities in an effort to increase equitable health outcomes.48

The health care industry is hardly alone in seeing transformations
driven by tech. ",,0
1293,"Simultaneously, four roundtable events
were hosted with 39 CAEs and 9 subject
matter experts were interviewed,
including CAEs, Audit Committee Chairs
and industry experts from a range of
countries to provide deeper insights
into how these risks are manifesting
and developing.

The topics in this report were determined
by the quantitative survey results and the
qualitative feedback from the roundtable
events and one-to-one interviews. The
format of this report differs from previous
years. Instead of giving each of the top ten
risk areas relatively equal prominence, it
was decided that a deeper look into areas
of pressing importance to internal audit
and their stakeholders would prove to be
more useful. That is why the qualitative
material has been used more prominently
to contextualise the survey results,
providing colour and up-to-the-minute

considerations for CAEs, with priority
given to new issues and emerging themes
that warrant attention.

This report should not be considered
prescriptive, but as a tool to inform internal
audit’s thinking in making their annual
plans and provide a benchmark against
which CAEs can contrast and compare their
own independent risk assessments.

People and talent (including succession challenges and the

cost of labor) dominate the top risk issues for healthcare

organizations, but competing priorities continue to test

boards and executive leadership throughout the industry.

Uncertain economic conditions fueled by inflationary

pressures and potential recessionary trends are raising

new questions about the outlook for the next 12 months.

1298,"Year-over-year cyberattacks continue to evolve and increase.

2023 Recommendations for Audit1. State-Sponsored Cyberattacks

2. Cyber Breach Disclosure Requirements

Key Risk Indicators

• State-sponsored cyberattacks against enterprises are already widespread, but

attackers’ changing motivations could increase and worsen them.

• Some current attacks steal cryptocurrencies or other assets for revenue

generation.

• Even before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, 39% of organizations already

believed that Russian state-sponsored actors targeted them. Worse, Ukraine
aligned governments believe Russia could retaliate against critical infrastructure

and key economic institutions in an escalation of conflict.

• Mean time to incident detection

• Mean time to incident resolution

• Mean time to recovery (MTTR) of compromised application

• Average time since last patching of systems and endpoints

• Number of “Shields Up”-type warnings by government agencies

• Several new and proposed breach disclosure requirements raise the possibility

that organizations may be forced to disclose reputationally damaging information

about cyber capabilities and conform to potentially burdensome disclosure

standards.

• A new law in the U.S. requires critical infrastructure companies to report cyber

incidents within 24 or 72 hours, depending on the event. ",1.0,0
1299,"In fact, close to 40% of survey respondents said they have switched or are
considering switching primary insurers this year in response to price increases (see Figure 9).

Note that 25% of respondents to our 2022 survey and 24% of respondents to our 2021 survey
said they were switching primary insurers, even though the market was also difficult when
data was being collected in 2020 and 2021, with double-digit average increases.

As they have in past years, respondents have shown eagerness to seek new insurers
throughout the program layers.

These shifts may indicate a continued move by tech companies toward retaining key risks
rather than transferring them. And if tech companies no longer rely as heavily on insurance to
manage their most critical risks, maintaining key primary insurer relationships may become
less important. And while insurance purchases remain critical for many tech companies, some
may be relying on them to transfer less critical risks or simply to meet regulatory or lending
requirements, further reducing the perceived importance of a long-term relationship with
their primary insurer and making switching carriers in search of better rates more attractive.
